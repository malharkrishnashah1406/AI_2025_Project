growing at home, but -- problems are growing abroad, but jobs aren't growing here at home.
Let me go back to this.
He says we're absolutely leaving in 2014.
You're saying that's not an absolute, but you won't talk about what conditions would justify... (CROSSTALK)
Do you know why we say that?
I'd like to know... (CROSSTALK)
Because we don't want to broadcast to our enemies "put a date on your calendar, wait us out, and then come back."
We want to make sure... (CROSSTALK)
But you agree with the timeline.
We do agree -- we do agree with the timeline and the transition, but what we -- what any administration will do in 2013 is assess the situation to see how best to complete this timeline.
What we do not want to do...
We will leave in 2014.
... what we don't want to do is give our allies reason to trust us less and our enemies more -- we don't want to embolden our enemies to hold and wait out for us and then take over... (CROSSTALK)
Martha, that's a bizarre statement.
That's why we want to make sure -- no, that's why we want to make sure that... (CROSSTALK)
Forty-nine of our allies -- hear me -- 49 of our allies signed on to this position.
And we're reading that they want to... (CROSSTALK)
Forty-nine -- 49 of our allies said "out in 2014."
It's the responsibility of the Afghans.
We have other responsibilities... (CROSSTALK)
Do you really think that this timeline... (CROSSTALK)
Which is -- which is... (CROSSTALK)
We have -- we have soldiers and Marines.
We have Afghan forces murdering our forces over there.
The Taliban is, do you think, taking advantage of this timeline?
Look, the Taliban -- what we've found out, and we -- you saw it in Iraq, Martha, unless you set a timeline, Baghdad, in the case of Iraq, and -- and Kabul, in the case of Afghanistan will not step up.
They're happy to let us continue to do the job; international security forces to do the job.
The only way they step up is to say, "Fellas, we're leaving; we've trained you; step up, step up."
Let me go back.
That's the only way it works.
Let me go back to the -- the surge troops that we put in there.
And -- and you brought this up, Congressman Ryan.
I have talked to a lot of troops.
I've talked to senior offices who were concerned that the surge troops were pulled out during the fighting season, and some of them saw that as a political -- as a political move.
So can you tell me, Vice President Biden, what was the military reason for bringing those surge troops home...
The military reason...
... before the fighting had ended?
... was bringing -- by the way, when the president announced the surge, you'll remember, Martha, he said the surge will be out by the end of the summer.
The military said the surge will be out.
Nothing political about this.
Before the surge occurred -- so you be a little straight with me here, too -- before the surge occurred, we said they'll be out by the end of the summer.
That's what the military said.
The reason for that is...
The military follows orders.
I mean, there -- trust me.
There are people who were concerned about pulling out on the fighting season.
Sure.
There are people that are concerned, but not the Joint Chiefs.
That was their recommendation in the Oval Office to the president of the United States of America.
I sat there.
I'm sure you'll find someone who disagrees with the Pentagon.
I'm positive you'll find that within the military.
But that's not the case here.
And, secondly, the reason why the military said that is, you cannot wait and have a cliff.
It takes -- you know -- months and months and months to draw down forces.
Let me... (CROSSTALK)
Let me try and illustrate the issue here, because I think this -- it can get a little confusing.
We've all met with General Allen and General Scaparrotti in Afghanistan to talk about fighting seasons.
Here's the way it works.
The mountain passes fill in with snow.
The Taliban and the terrorists and the Haqqani and the Quetta Shura come over from Pakistan to fight our men and women.
When it fills in with snow, they can't do it.
That's what we call fighting seasons.
In the warm months, fighting gets really high.
In the winter, it goes down.
And so when Admiral Mullen and General Petraeus came to Congress and said, if you pull these people out before the fighting season is end, it puts people more at risk.
That's the problem.
Yes, we drew 22,000 troops down last month, but the remaining troops that are there, who still have the same mission to prosecute counterinsurgency, are doing it with fewer people.
That makes them less safe.
Fighting season...
We're sending fewer people out in all of these hotspots to do the same job that they were supposed to do a month ago.
Because we turned it over...
But we took 22,000 people out...
... we turned it over to the Afghan troops we trained.
No one got pulled out that didn't get filled in by trained Afghan personnel.
And he's -- he's conflating two issues.
The fighting season that Petraeus was talking about and former -- and Admiral Mullen was the fighting season this spring.
That's what he was talking about.
We did not -- we did not pull them out.
The calendar works the same every year.
It does work the same every year.
But we're not staying there...
Spring, summer, fall.
It's warm, or it's not.
They're still fighting us.
They're still coming over the passes.
They're still coming into Zabul, to Kunar, to all of these areas, but we are sending fewer people to the front to fight them.
And that's... (CROSSTALK)
That's right, because that's the Afghan responsibility.
We've trained them.
Not in the east.
Let's move -- let's move to another war.
Not in the east?
R.C.
East -- R.C.
East...
R.C.
East is the most dangerous place in the world.
That's right.
That's why we don't want to send fewer people to the...
That's -- that's why we should send Americans in to do the job, instead of the -- you'd rather Americans be going in doing the job instead of the trainees?
No.
We are already sending Americans to do the job, but fewer of them.
That's the whole problem.
That's right.
We're sending in more Afghans to do the job, Afghans to do the job.
Let's move to another war, the civil war in Syria, where there are estimates that more -- estimates that more than 25,000, 30,000 people have now been killed.
In March of last year, President Obama explained the military action taken in Libya by saying it was in the national interest to go in and prevent further massacres from occurring there.
So why doesn't the same logic apply in Syria?
Vice President Biden?
Different country.
It's a different country.
It is five times as large geographically, it has one-fifth the population, that is Libya, one-fifth the population, five times as large geographically.
It's in a part of the world where they're not going to see whatever would come from that war.
It seep into a regional war.
You're in a country that is heavily populated in the midst of the most dangerous area in the world.
And, in fact, if in fact it blows up and the wrong people gain control, it's going to have impact on the entire region causing potentially regional wars.
We are working hand and glove with the Turks, with the Jordanians, with the Saudis, and with all the people in the region attempting to identify the people who deserve the help so that when Assad goes -- and he will go -- there will be a legitimate government that follows on, not an Al Qaida-sponsored government that follows on.
And all this loose talk of my friend, Governor Romney, and the congressman, about how we're going to do, we could do so much more in there, what more would they do other than put American boots on the ground?
The last thing America needs is to get in another ground war in the Middle East, requiring tens of thousands, if not well over 100,000 American forces.
That -- they are the facts.
They are the facts.
Now, every time the governor is asked about this, he doesn't say anything.
He -- he goes up with a whole lot of verbiage, but when he gets pressed he says, no, he would not do anything different than we are doing now.
Are they proposing putting American troops on the ground?
Putting American aircraft in the airspace?
Is that what they're proposing?
If they do, they should speak up and say so, but that's not what they're saying.
We are doing it exactly like we need to do to identify those forces who, in fact, will provide for a stable government and not cause a regional Sunni-Shia war when Bassad (sic) -- when Bashar Assad falls.
Congressman Ryan?
Nobody is proposing to send troops to Syria.
American troops.
Now, let me say it this way.
How would we do things differently?
We wouldn't refer to Bashar Assad as a reformer when he's killing his own civilians with his Russian-provided weapons.
We wouldn't be outsourcing our foreign policy to the United Nations giving Vladimir Putin veto power over our efforts to try and deal with this issue.
He's vetoed three of them.
Hillary Clinton went to Russia to try and convince them not to do so.
They thwarted her efforts.
She said they were on the wrong side of history.
She was right about that.
This is just one more example of how the Russia reset's not working.
And so where are we?
After international pressure mounted, the President Obama said Bashar Assad should go.
It's been over a year.
The man has slaughtered tens of thousands of his own people.
And more foreign fighters are spilling into this country.
So the longer this has gone on, the more people, groups like Al Qaida are going in.
We could have more easily identified the free Syrian army, the freedom fighters, working with our allies, the Turks, the Qataris, the Saudis, had we had a better plan in place to begin with working through our allies.
But, no, we waited for Kofi Annan to try and come up with an agreement through the U.N. That bought Bashar Assad time.
We gave Russia veto power over our efforts through the U.N. And meanwhile about 30,000 Syrians are dead.
What would my friend do differently?
If you notice, he never answers the question.
No, I would -- I -- we would not be going through the U.N. in all of these things.
Let me -- you don't go through the U.N. We are in the process now -- and have been for months -- in making sure that help, humanitarian aid, as well as other aid and training is getting to those forces that we believe, the Turks believe, the Jordanians believe, the Saudis believe are the free forces inside of Syria.
That is underway.
Our allies were all on the same page, NATO, as well as our Arab allies, in terms of trying to get a settlement.
That was their idea.
We're the ones that said, "Enough."
With regard to the reset not working, the fact of the matter is that Russia has a different interest in Syria than we do, and that's not in our interest.
What happens if Assad does not fall, Congressman Ryan?
What happens to the region?
What happens if he hangs on?
What happens if he does?
Then Iran keeps their greatest ally in the region.
He's a sponsor of terrorism.
He'll probably continue slaughtering his people.
We and the world community will lose our credibility on this.
Look, he mentioned the reset...
So what would Romney-Ryan do about that credibility?
Well, we agree with the same red line, actually, they do on chemical weapons, but not putting American troops in, other than to secure those chemical weapons.
They're right about that.
But what we should have done earlier is work with those freedom fighters, those dissidents in Syria.
We should not have called Bashar Assad a reformer.
And...
What's your criteria... (CROSSTALK)
... we should not have -- we should not have waited to Russia...
What's your criteria... (CROSSTALK)
... should not have waited for Russia to give us the green light at the U.N. to do something about it.
Russia...
They're -- they're still arming the man.
Iran is flying flights over Iraq...
And the opposition is being armed.
... to help Bashar Assad.
And, by the way, if we had the status-of-forces agreement that the vice president said he would bet his vice presidency on in Iraq, we probably would have been able to prevent that.
But he failed to achieve that, as well, again.
Let me ask you a quick question.
I don't...
What's your criteria for intervention?
Yeah.
In Syria?
Worldwide.
What is in the national interests of the American people.
How about humanitarian interests?
What is in the national security of the American people.
It's got to be in the strategic national interests of our country.
No humanitarian?
Each situation will -- will come up with its own set of circumstances, but putting American troops on the ground?
That's got to be within the national security interests of the American people.
I want to -- we're -- we're almost out of time here.
That means like embargoes and sanctions and overflights, those are things that don't put American troops on the ground.
But if you're talking about putting American troops on the ground, only in our national security interests.
I want to move on, and I want to return home for these last few questions.
This debate is, indeed, historic.
We have two Catholic candidates, first time, on a stage such as this.
And I would like to ask you both to tell me what role your religion has played in your own personal views on abortion.
Please talk about how you came to that decision.
Talk about how your religion played a part in that.
And, please, this is such an emotional issue for so many people in this country...
Sure.
... please talk personally about this, if you could.
Congressman Ryan?
I don't see how a person can separate their public life from their private life or from their faith.
Our faith informs us in everything we do.
My faith informs me about how to take care of the vulnerable, of how to make sure that people have a chance in life.
Now, you want to ask basically why I'm pro-life?
It's not simply because of my Catholic faith.
That's a factor, of course.
But it's also because of reason and science.
You know, I think about 10 1/2 years ago, my wife Janna and I went to Mercy Hospital in Janesville where I was born, for our seven week ultrasound for our firstborn child, and we saw that heartbeat.
A little baby was in the shape of a bean.
And to this day, we have nicknamed our firstborn child Liza, "Bean."
Now I believe that life begins at conception.
That's why -- those are the reasons why I'm pro-life.
Now I understand this is a difficult issue, and I respect people who don't agree with me on this, but the policy of a Romney administration will be to oppose abortions with the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.
What troubles me more is how this administration has handled all of these issues.
Look at what they're doing through Obamacare with respect to assaulting the religious liberties of this country.
They're infringing upon our first freedom, the freedom of religion, by infringing on Catholic charities, Catholic churches, Catholic hospitals.
Our church should not have to sue our federal government to maintain their religious liberties.
And with respect to abortion, the Democratic Party used to say they wanted it to be safe, legal and rare.
Now they support it without restriction and with taxpayer funding.
Taxpayer funding in Obamacare, taxpayer funding with foreign aid.
The vice president himself went to China and said that he sympathized and wouldn't second guess their one child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations.
That to me is pretty extreme.
Vice President Biden?
My religion defines who I am, and I've been a practicing Catholic my whole life.
And has particularly informed my social doctrine.
The Catholic social doctrine talks about taking care of those who -- who can't take care of themselves, people who need help.
With regard to -- with regard to abortion, I accept my church's position on abortion as a -- what we call a (inaudible) doctrine.
Life begins at conception in the church's judgment.
I accept it in my personal life.
But I refuse to impose it on equally devout Christians and Muslims and Jews, and I just refuse to impose that on others, unlike my friend here, the -- the congressman.
I -- I do not believe that we have a right to tell other people that -- women they can't control their body.
It's a decision between them and their doctor.
In my view and the Supreme Court, I'm not going to interfere with that.
With regard to the assault on the Catholic church, let me make it absolutely clear, no religious institution, Catholic or otherwise, including Catholic Social Services, Georgetown Hospital, Mercy Hospital, any hospital, none has to either refer contraception, none has to pay for contraception, none has to be a vehicle to get contraception in any insurance policy they provide.
That is a fact.
That is a fact.
Now with regard to the way in which the -- we differ, my friend says that he -- well I guess he accepts Governor Romney's position now, because in the past he has argued that there was -- there's rape and forcible rape.
He's argued that in the case of rape or incest, it was still -- it would be a crime to engage in having an abortion.
I just fundamentally disagree with my friend.
Congressman Ryan.
All I'm saying is, if you believe that life begins at conception, that, therefore, doesn't change the definition of life.
That's a principle.
The policy of a Romney administration is to oppose abortion with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.
Now, I've got to take issue with the Catholic church and religious liberty.
You have on the issue... (CROSSTALK)
... why would they keep -- why would they keep suing you?
It's a distinction without a difference.
I want to go back to the abortion question here.
If the Romney-Ryan ticket is elected, should those who believe that abortion should remain legal be worried?
We don't think that unelected judges should make this decision; that people through their elected representatives in reaching a consensus in society through the democratic process should make this determination.
The court -- the next president will get one or two Supreme Court nominees.
That's how close Roe v. Wade is.
Just ask yourself, with Robert Bork being the chief adviser on the court for -- for Mr. Romney, who do you think he's likely to appoint?
Do you think he's likely to appoint someone like Scalia or someone else on the court far right that would outlaw (inaudible) -- outlaw abortion?
I suspect that would happen.
I guarantee you, that will not happen.
We picked two people.
We pick people who are open-minded.
They've been good justices.
So keep an eye on the Supreme Court...
Was there a litmus test on them?
There was no litmus test.
We picked people who had an open mind; did not come with an agenda.
I'm -- I'm going to move on to this closing question because we are running out of time.
Certainly (inaudible) and you've said it here tonight, that the two of you respect our troops enormously.
Your son has served and perhaps someday your children will serve as well.
I recently spoke to a highly decorated soldier who said that this presidential campaign has left him dismayed.
He told me, quote, "the ads are so negative and they are all tearing down each other rather than building up the country."
