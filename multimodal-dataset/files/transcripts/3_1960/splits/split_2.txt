got to see that America grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly.
Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union; even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration; that isn't good enough.
Because America must be able to grow enough not only to take care of our needs at home for better education and housing and health - all these things we want.
We've got to grow enough to maintain the forces that we have abroad and to wage the non-military battle for the war - uh - for the world in Asia, in Africa and Latin America.
It's going to cost more money, and growth will help us to win that battle.
Now, what do we do about it?
And here I believe basically that what we have to do is to stimulate that sector of America, the private enterprise sector of the economy, in which there is the greatest possibility for expansion.
So that is why I advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy.
In addition to that, we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth.
I refer, for example, to distressed areas.
We have to move into those areas with programs so that we make adequate use of the resources of those areas.
We also have to see that all of the people of the United States - the tremendous talents that our people have - are used adequately.
That's why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, it's for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need.
And in addition to that, we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth.
Now what all this, of course, adds up to is this: America has not been standing still.
Let's get that straight.
Anybody who says America's been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling around America.
He's been traveling in some other country.
We have been moving.
We have been moving much faster than we did in the Truman years.
But we can and must move faster, and that's why I stand so strongly for programs that will move America forward in the sixties, move her forward so that we can stay ahead of the Soviet Union and win the battle for freedom and peace.
Senator Kennedy.
Well first may I correct a statement which was made before, that under my agricultural program food prices would go up twenty-five percent.
That's untrue.
The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread.
Even if you put his income up ten percent, that would be two and three-quarters percent three pers- or three cents out of that twenty-five cents.
The t- man who grows tomatoes - it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can.
And I believe when the average hour for many farmers' wage is about fifty cents an hour, he should do better.
But anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error.
The Vice President suggested a number of things.
He suggested that we aid distressed areas.
The Administration has vetoed that bill passed by the Congress twice.
He suggested we pass an aid to education bill.
But the Administration and the Republican majority in the Congress has opposed any realistic aid to education.
And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers' salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added.
This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth - which means jobs - of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959.
And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we're going to have to grow more.
Governor Rockefeller says five per cent.
The Democratic platform and others say five per cent.
Many say four and a half per cent.
The last eight years the average growth has been about two and a half per cent.
That's why we don't have full employment today.
Mr. McGee has the next question for Senator Kennedy.
Uh - Senator Kennedy, a moment ago you mentioned tax loopholes.
Now your running mate, Senator Lyndon Johnson, is from Texas, an oil-producing state and one that many political leaders feel is in doubt in this election year.
And reports from there say that oil men in Texas are seeking assurance from Senator Johnson that the oil depletion allowance will not be cut.
The Democratic platform pledges to plug holes in the tax laws and refers to inequitable depletion allowance as being conspicuous loopholes.
My question is, do you consider the twenty-seven and a half per cent depletion allowance inequitable, and would you ask that it be cut?
Uh - Mr. McGee, there are about a hundred and four commodities that have some kind of depletion allowance - different kind of minerals, including oil.
I believe all of those should be gone over in detail to make sure that no one is getting a tax break; to make sure that no one is getting away from paying the taxes he ought to pay.
That includes oil; it includes all kinds of minerals; it includes everything within the range of taxation.
We want to be sure it's fair and equitable.
It includes oil abroad.
Perhaps that oil abroad should be treated differently than the oil here at home.
Now the oil industry recently has had hard times.
Particularly some of the smaller producers.
They're moving about eight or nine days in Texas.
But I can assure you that if I'm elected president, the whole spectrum of taxes will be gone through carefully.
And if there is any inequities in oil or any other commodity, then I would vote to close that loophole, I have voted in the past to reduce the depletion allowance for the largest producers; for those from five million dollars down, to maintain it at twenty-seven and a half per cent.
I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest, and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth; how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward.
Mr. Vice President.
Senator Kennedy's position and mine completely different on this.
I favor the present depletion allowance.
I favor it not because I want to make a lot of oil men rich, but because I want to make America rich.
Why do we have a depletion allowance?
Because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it.
If we didn't have a depletion allowance of certainly, I believe, the present amount, we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country.
Now, as far as my position then is concerned, it is exactly opposite to the Senator's.
And it's because of my belief that if America is going to have the growth that he talks about and that I talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them.
And so he would be doing exactly the wrong thing.
One other thing.
He suggests that there are a number of other items in this whole depletion field that could be taken into account.
He also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws, including depletion.
I should point out that as far as depletion allowances are concerned, the oil depletion allowance is one that provides eighty percent of all of those involved in depletion, so you're not going to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowances are concerned, unless you move in the area that he indicated.
But I oppose it.
I oppose it for the reasons that I mentioned.
I oppose it because I want us to have more oil exploration and not less.
Gentlemen, if I may remind you, time is growing short, so please keep your questions and answers as brief as possible consistent with clarity.
Mr.
Von Fremd for Vice President Nixon.
Mr. Vice President, in the past three years, there has been an exodus of more than four billion dollars of gold from the United States, apparently for two reasons: because exports have slumped and haven't covered imports, and because of increased American investments abroad.
If you were president, how would you go about stopping this departure of gold from our shores?
Well, Mr.
Von Fremd, the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the American dollar.
That means that we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can; because the moment that we have loss of confidence in our own fiscal policies at home, it results in gold flowing out.
Secondly, we have to increase our exports, as compared with our imports.
And here we have a very strong program going forward in the Department of Commerce.
This one must be stepped up.
Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh - we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom.
Now America has been carrying a tremendous load in this respect.
I think we have been right in carrying it.
I have favored our programs abroad for economic assistance and for military assistance.
But now we find that the countries of Europe for example, that we have aided, and Japan, that we've aided in the Far East; these countries - some our former enemies, have now recovered completely.
They have got to bear a greater share of this load of economic assistance abroad.
That's why I am advocating, and will develop during the course of the next Administration - if, of course, I get the opportunity - a program in which we enlist more aid from these other countries on a concerted basis in the programs of economic development for Africa, Asia and Latin America.
The United States cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself.
We can a big share of it, but we've got to have more help from our friends abroad; and these three factors, I think, will be very helpful in reversing the gold flow which you spoke about.
Senator Kennedy.
Just to uh - correct the record, Mr. Nixon said on depletion that his record was the opposite of mine.
What I said was that this matter should be thoroughly gone into to make sure that there aren't loopholes.
If his record is the opposite of that, that means that he doesn't want to go into it.
Now on the question of gold.
The difficulty, of course, is that we do have heavy obligations abroad, that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops, maintain our bases, and sustain other economies.
In other words, if we're going to continue to maintain our position in the sixties, we have to maintain a sound monetary and fiscal policy.
We have to have control over inflation, and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade.
We have to be able to compete in the world market.
We have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume uh - from abroad if we're going to be able to meet our obligations.
In addition, many of the countries around the world still keep restrictions against our goads, going all the way back to the days when there was a dollar shortage.
Now there isn't a dollar shortage, and yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods.
I believe that we must be able to compete in the market - steel and in all the basic commodities abroad - we must be able to compete against them because we always did because of our technological lead.
We have to be sure to maintain that.
We have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in, not to act as if there was a dollar gap; and third, we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now we've maintained, to assist underdeveloped countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia make an economic breakthrough on their own.
Mr. Drummond's question now for Senator Kennedy.
Senator Kennedy, a question on American prestige.
In light of the fact that the Soviet Ambassador was recently expelled from the Congo, and that Mr. Khrushchev has this week canceled his trip to Cuba for fear of stirring resentment throughout all Latin America, I would like to ask you to spell out somewhat more fully how you think we should measure American prestige, to determine whether it is rising or whether it is falling.
Well, I think there are many uh - tests, Mr. Drummond, of prestige.
And the significance of prestige, really, is because we're so identified with the cause of freedom.
Therefore, if we are on the mount, if we are rising, if our influence is spreading, if our prestige is spreading, then those uh - who stand now on the razor edge of decision between us or between the Communist system, wondering whether they should use the system of freedom to develop their countries or the system of Communism, they'll be persuaded to follow our example.
There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was.
Mr. George Allen, the head of our information service, said that a result of our being second in space, in the sputnik in 1957, and I quote him, I believe I paraphrase him accurately.
He said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific advancement.
And therefore, he said, many of these countries now feel that the Soviet Union, which was once so backward, is now on a par with the United States.
Secondly, the economic growth of the Soviet Union is greater than ours.
Mr. Dulles has suggested it's from two to three times as great as ours.
This has a great effect on the s- underdeveloped world, which faces problems of low income and high population density and inadequate resources.
Three, a Gallup Poll taken in February asked people in ten countries which country they thought would be first in 1970, both scientifically and militarily.
And a majority in every country except Greece, felt that it would be the Soviet Union by l970.
Four, in the votes at the U.N., particularly the vote dealing with Red China last Saturday, we received the support on the position that we had taken of only two African countries - one, Liberia, which had been tied to us for more than a century, and the other, Union of South Africa, which is not a popular country in Africa.
Every other ca- African country either abstained or voted against us.
A - More countries voted against us in Asia on this issue than voted with us.
On the neutralists' resolution, which we were so much opposed to, the same thing happened.
The candidate who was a candidate for the president of Brazil, took a trip to Cuba to call on Mr. Castro during the election in order to get the benefit of the Castro supporters uh - within Brazil.
There are many indications.
Guinea and Ghana, two independent countries within the last three years - Guinea in fifty-seven, Ghana within the last eighteen months - both now are supporting the Soviet foreign policy at the U.N. Mr. Herter said so himself.
Laos is moving in that direction.
So I would say our prestige is not so high.
No longer do we give the image of being on the rise.
No longer do we give an image of vitality.
Mr. Vice President.
Well, I would say first of all that Senator's - Kennedy's statement that he's just made is not going to help our Gallup Polls abroad and it isn't going to help our prestige either.
Let's look at the other side of the coin.
Let's look at the vote on the Congo, the vote was seventy to nothing against the Soviet Union.
Let's look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really is.
We find that the Soviet Union is a very primitive economy.
Its growth rate is not what counts; it's whether it is catching up with us and it is not catching up with us.
We're well ahead and we can stay ahead, provided we have confidence in America and don't run her down in order to build her up.
We could look also at other items which Senator Kennedy has named, but I will only conclude by saying this: in this whole matter of prestige, in the final analysis, its whether you stand for what's right.
And getting back to this matter that we discussed at the outset, the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.
I can think of nothing that will be a greater blow to the prestige of the United States among the free nations in Asia than for us to take Senator Kennedy's advan- advice to go - go against what a majority of the members of the Senate, both Democrat and Republican, did - said in 1955, and to say in advance we will surrender an area to the Communists.
In other words, if the United States is going to maintain its strength and its prestige, we must not only be strong militarily and economically, we must be firm diplomatically.
Thi- Certainly we have been speaking, I know, of whether we should have retreat or defeat.
Let's remember the way to win is not to retreat and not to surrender.
