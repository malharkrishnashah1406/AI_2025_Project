Again, if you're not rich, you're not a superpower.
So we have two that I'd put as number one.
I have number 1 and 1A.
One is we've got to have the money to be able to pay for defense, and we've got to manufacture here.
Believe it or not folks, you can't ship it all overseas, you've got to make it here.
And you can't convert from potato chips to airplanes in an emergency.
See, Willow Run could be converted from cars to airplanes in World War II because it was here.
We've got to make things here.
You can't ship them overseas anymore.
I hope we can talk more about that.
Second thing, on priorities.
We've got to help Russia succeed in its revolution and all of its republics.
When we think of Russia, remember we're thinking of many countries, now.
We've got to help them.
That's pennies on the dollar compared to renewing the cold war.
Third, we've got all kinds of agreements on paper, and some that are being executed on getting rid of nuclear warheads.
Russia and its republics are out of control or at best in weak control right now.
It's a very unstable situation.
You've got every rich Middle Eastern country over there trying to buy nuclear weapons.
As you well know.
And that will lead to another five star migraine headache down the road.
We really need to nail down the big intercontinental ballistic missiles, the ones that can hit us from Russia.
And we've focused on the tactical.
We've made real progress there.
We've got some agreement on the nuclear, but we don't have those things put away yet.
The sooner the better.
So, in terms of priorities, we've got to be financially strong.
Number two, we've got to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind us and give this thing very high priority.
And number three, we need to help and support Russia and the republics in every possible way to become democratic capitalistic societies, and not just sit back and let those countries continue in turmoil.
Because they could go back worse than things used to be.
And believe me there are a lot of old boys in the K.G.B.
and the military that liked it better the way it used to be.
Governor Clinton, one minute.
In order to keep America the strongest nation in the world, we need some continuity and some change.
There are three fundamental challenges.
First of all, the world is still a dangerous and uncertain place.
We need a new military and a new national security policy equal to the challenges of a post cold war era, a smaller permanent military force, but one that is more mobile, well trained with high technology equipment.
We need to continue the negotiations to reduce the nuclear arsenals in the Soviet Union, the former Soviet Union, and the United States.
We need to stop this proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
Second, we have to face that in this world, economic security is a whole lot of national security.
Our dollar's at an all time low against some foreign currencies.
We're weak in the world.
We must rebuild America's strength at home.
And finally, we ought to be promoting the democratic impulses around the world.
Democracies are our partners.
They don't go to war with each other.
They're reliable friends in the future.
National security, economic strength, democracy.
President Bush, one minute.
Well, we still are the envy of the world in terms of our military.
There's no question about that.
We're the envy of the world in terms of our economy, despite the difficulties we're having.
There's no question about that.
Our exports are dramatically up.
I might say to Mr. Perot, I can understand why you might have missed it, because there's so much fascination with trivia, but I worked out a deal with Boris Yeltsin to eliminate, get rid of entirely, the most destabilizing weapons of all, the SS-18, the intercontinental ballistic missile.
I mean, that's been done.
And thank God, it has, because the parents of these young people around here go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war.
We made dramatic progress.
And so, we've got a good military.
the question, to sort of get a new military, get the best in the world, we got it, and theyâ€™re keeping the peace, and they're respected around the world.
And we're more respected because of the way we have conducted ourselves.
We didn't listen to the nuclear freeze crowd.
We said, "Peace through strength," and it worked and the cold war is over.
And America understands that.
But we're so, turned so inward we don't understand the global picture.
And we are helping democracy, Ross.
The Freedom Support Act is something I got through the Congress, and it's a very good thing, because it does exactly what you say, and I think you agree with that, to help Russian democracy.
And we're going to keep on doing that.
Next question is for Governor Clinton, and John will ask it.
Governor Clinton, you accused the President of coddling tyrants, including those in Beijing.
As President, how would you exert U.S. power to influence affairs in China.
I think our relationships with China are important and I don't want to isolate China, but I think it is a mistake for us to do what this Administration did when all those kids went out there carrying the Statue of Liberty in Tiananmen Square.
Mr Bush sent two people in secret to toast the Chinese leaders and basically tell them not to worry about it.
They rewarded him by opening negotiations with Iran to transfer nuclear technology.
That was their response to that sort of action.
Now that the voices in the Congress and throughout the country have insisted that we do something about China, look at what has happened.
China has finally agreed to stop sending us products made with prison labor.
Not because we coddled them, but because the Administration was pushed into doing something about it.
And recently the Chinese have announced they are going to lower some barriers to our products, which they ought to do since they have a 15 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States under Mr. Bush.
The second biggest surplus next to Japan.
So I would be firm.
I would say if you want to continue as Most Favored Nation status for your government owned industries as well as your private ones, observe human rights in the future.
Open your society.
Recognize the legitimacy of those kids that were carrying the Statue of Liberty.
If we can stand up for our economics, we ought to be able to preserve the democratic interests of the people of China.
And over the long run they will be more reliable partners.
President you have one minute.
Well, the Administration was the first major country to stand up to the abuse in Tiananmen Square.
We are the one that worked out the prison labor deal.
We are the ones that lowered the barrier to products with Carla Hill's negotiation.
I am the one that said let's keep the M.F.N.
because you see China moving towards a free market economy.
To do what the Congress and Governor Clinton is suggesting, you'd isolate and ruin Hong Kong.
They are making some progress, not enough for us.
We were the first ones to put sanctions on.
We still have them on, on some things.
But Governor Clinton's philosophy is isolate them.
He says don't do it, but the policies he's expounding of putting conditions on M.F.N.
and kind of humiliating them is not the way you make the kind of progress we are getting.
And I've stood up with these people, and I understand what you have to do to be strong in this situation, and it's moving, not as fast as we'd like.
But you isolate China and turn them inward, and then we've made a tremendous mistake.
And I'm not going to do it.
And I've had to fight a lot of people that were saying human rights, and weâ€™re the ones that put the sanctions on and stood for it.
And he can insult General Scowcroft if he wants to.
They didn't go over to coddle.
He went over to say we must make the very changes they're making now.
One minute, Mr. Perot.
All right, it's huge.
China, is a huge country, broken into many provinces.
It has some very elderly leaders that will not be around too much longer.
Capitalism is growing and thriving across big portions of China.
Asia will be our largest trading partner in the future.
It will be a growing and a closer relationship.
We have a delicate, tight-wire walk that we must go through at the present time to make sure that we do not cozy up to tyrants, to make sure that they don't get the impression that they can suppress their people.
But time is our friend there, because their leaders will change in not too many years, worst case, and their country is making great progress.
One last point on the missiles.
I don't want the American people to be confused.
We have written agreements and we have some missiles that have been destroyed, but we have a huge number of intercontinental ballistic missiles that are still in place in Russia.
The fact that you have an agreement is one thing.
Till they're destroyed, some crazy person can either sell them or use them.
All right.
The next question goes to President Bush for a 2-minute answer, and Ann will ask it.
Mr. President, how can you watch the killing in Bosnia and the ethnic cleansing, or the starvation and anarchy in Somalia, and not want to use America's might, if not America's military, to try to end that kind of suffering?
Ann, both of them are very complicated situations.
And I vowed something because I learned something from Vietnam.
I am not going to commit US forces until I know what the mission is, till the military tell me that it can be completed, and till I know how they can come out.
We are helping.
American airplanes are helping today on humanitarian relief for Sarajevo.
It is America that's in the lead in helping with humanitarian relief for Somalia.
But when you go to put somebody else's son or daughter into war, I think you got to be a little bit careful and you have to be sure that there's a military plan that can do this.
You have ancient ethnic rivalries that have cropped up as Yugoslavia's dissolved or getting dissolved, and it isn't going to be solved by sending in the 82nd Airborne, and I'm not going to do that as commander-in-chief.
I am going to stand by and use the moral persuasion of the US to get satisfaction in terms of prison camps, and we're making some progress there, and in terms of getting humanitarian relief in there.
And right now, as you know, the US took the lead in a no-fly operation up there in-- no- fly order up in the United Nations.
We're working through the international organizations.
That's one thing I learned by forging that tremendous and greatly--highly successful coalition against Saddam Hussein, the dictator.
Use--work internationally to do it.
I am very concerned about it.
I am concerned about ethnic cleansing.
I am concerned about a tax on Muslims, for example, over there.
But I must stop short of using American force until I know how those young men and women are going to get out of there as well as get in, know what the mission is, and define it.
And I think I'm on the right track.
Are you designing a mission,
Ms.--Ann, sorry, sorry.
Time is up.
We have to go to Mr. Perot for a one-minute response.
I think if we learned anything in Vietnam is you first commit this nation before you commit the troops to the battlefield.
We cannot send our people all over the world to solve every problem that comes up.
This is basically a problem that is a primary concern to the European Community.
Certainly we care about the people, we care about the children, we care about the tragedy.
But it is inappropriate for us, just because there's a problem somewhere around the world, to take the sons and daughters of working people--and make no mistake about it, our all- volunteer armed force is not made up of the sons and daughters of the beautiful people; it's the working folks who send their sons and daughters to war, with a few exceptions.
It's very unlike World War II, when FDR's sons flew missions.
Everybody went.
It's a different world now.
It's very important that we not just, without thinking it through, just rush to every problem in the world and have our people torn to pieces.
Governor Clinton, one minute.
I agree that we cannot commit ground forces to become involved in the quagmire of Bosnia or in the tribal wars of Somalia.
But I think that it's important to recognize that there are things that can be done short of that, and that we do have interests there.
There are, after all, 2 million refugees now because of the problems in what was Yugoslavia, the largest number since World War II, and there may be hundreds of thousands of people who will starve or freeze to death in this winter.
The US should try to work with its allies and stop it.
I urged the president to support this air cover, and he did--and I applaud that.
I applaud the no-fly zone, and I know that he's going back to the United Nations to try to get authority to enforce it.
I think we should stiffen the embargo on the Belgrade government, and I think we have to consider whether or not we should lift the arms embargo now on the Bosnians, since they are in no way in a fair fight with a heavily armed opponent bent on ethnic cleansing.
We can't get involved in the quagmire, but we must do what we can.
