have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society.
Now, having that, I think also that in leadership -- well, I believe that you find people, positions such as I'm in who have the talent and ability to do the things that are needed in the various departments of government.
I don't believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who's going to play tennis on the White House court.
And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job.
You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job.
But I also believe something else about that.
I believe that -- and when I became Governor of California, I started this, and I continue it in this office -- that any issue that comes before me, I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue.
I don't want to hear them.
I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people -- is it morally right?
And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue.
Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren't to be abhorred -- that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.
As a followup, let me draw in another specific, if I could -- a specific that the Democrats have claimed about your campaign -- that it is essentially based on imagery.
And one specific that they allege is that, for instance, recently you showed up at the opening ceremony of a Buffalo old-age housing project, when in fact, your policy was to cut Federal housing subsidies for the elderly.
Yet you were there to have your picture taken with them.
Our policy was not to cut subsidies.
We have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure.
And this is what we've been trying to do, is involve the Federal Government in such partnerships.
We are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people, and we're going to continue along that line.
We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need.
We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need.
The safety net is there, and we're taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.
Mr. Mondale, an opportunity for you to rebut.
Well, I guess I'm reminded a little bit of what Will Rogers once said about Hoover.
He said, "It's not what he doesn't know that bothers me; it's what he knows for sure that just ain't so.''
[Laughter] The fact of it is: The President's budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent.
It's not an opinion; it's a fact.
And when the President was asked the other day, "What do you want to cut in the budget?
'', he said, "Cut those things I asked for but didn't get.''
That's Social Security and Medicare.
The second fact is that the housing unit for senior citizens that the President dedicated in Buffalo was only made possible through a Federal assistance program for senior citizens that the President's budget sought to terminate.
So, if he'd had his way, there wouldn't have been any housing project there at all.
This administration has taken a meat cleaver out, in terms of Federal-assisted housing, and the record is there.
We have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions.
Mr. President?
Well, let me just respond with regard to Social Security.
When we took office, we discovered that the program that the Carter-Mondale administration had said would solve the fiscal problems of Social Security for the next 50 years wouldn't solve them for 5.
Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983.
Any proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman, a Democrat, of one of the leading committees, who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce.
And so, we made a proposal.
And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign.
And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke.
Indeed, we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks.
And then I asked for a bipartisan commission, which I'd asked for from the beginning, to sit down and work out a solution.
And so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.
Mr. President, we begin segment number three with Fred Barnes.
Religion
Mr. President, would you describe your religious beliefs, noting particularly whether you consider yourself a born-again Christian, and explain how these beliefs affect your Presidential decisions?
Well, I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of a church since I was a small boy.
In our particular church, we did not use that term, "born again,'' so I don't know whether I would fit that -- that particular term.
But I have -- thanks to my mother, God rest her soul -- the firmest possible belief and faith in God.
And I don't believe -- I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not -- I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others.
And I do resort to prayer.
At the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign -- or religion a part of that campaign.
As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondale's running mate said I wasn't a good Christian.
So, it does play a part in my life.
I have no hesitancy in saying so.
And, as I say, I don't believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered.
Given those beliefs, Mr. President, why don't you attend services regularly, either by going to church or by inviting a minister to the White House, as President Nixon used to do, or someone to Camp David, as President Carter used to do?
The answer to your question is very simple about why I don't go to church.
I have gone to church regularly all my life, and I started to here in Washington.
And now, in the position I hold and in the world in which we live, where Embassies do get blown up in Beirut -- we're supposed to talk about that on the debate the 21st, I understand -- but I pose a threat to several hundred people if I go to church.
I know the threats that are made against me.
We all know the possibility of terrorism.
We have seen the barricades that have had to be built around the White House.
And, therefore, I don't feel -- and my minister knows this and supports me in this position -- I don't feel that I have a right to go to church, knowing that my being there could cause something of the kind that we have seen in other places, in Beirut, for example.
And I miss going to church, but I think the Lord understands.
[Applause]
May I ask you, please -- [applause] -- may I ask the audience please to refrain from applause.
Fred, your second question.
Mr. Mondale, would you describe your religious beliefs and mention whether you consider yourself a born-again Christian, and explain how those beliefs would affect your decisions as President?
First of all, I accept President Reagan's affirmation of faith.
I'm sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact.
I am a son of a Methodist minister.
My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister.
And I don't know if I've been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family.
And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency.
Whether that helps or not, I don't know.
I have a deep religious faith.
Our family does.
It is fundamental.
It's probably the reason that I'm in politics.
I think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead.
And I think we're all together on that.
What bothers me is this growing tendency to try to use one's own personal interpretation of faith politically, to question others' faith, and to try to use the instrumentalities of government to impose those views on others.
All history tells us that that's a mistake.
When the Republican platform says that from here on out, we're going to have a religious test for judges before they're selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think that's an abuse of faith in our country.
This nation is the most religious nation on Earth -- more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth -- and it's because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith.
That's why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians.
And I think if we want to continue -- as I do -- to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.
Thank you.
Mr. Barnes, next question.
We have time for rebuttal now.
I think I have a followup.
Yes, I asked you if you did.
I'm sorry -- --
Yes, I do.
-- -- I thought you waived it.
Yes, Mr. Mondale, you've complained, just now, about Jerry Falwell, and you've complained other times about other fundamentalists in politics.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't recall your ever complaining about ministers who are involved in the civil rights movement or in the anti-Vietnam war demonstrations or about black preachers who've been so involved in American politics.
Is it only conservative ministers that you object to?
No.
What I object to -- [applause] -- what I object to -- what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others.
A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire.
The fact that the faith speaks to us and that we are moral people, hopefully, I accept and rejoice in.
It's when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political -- or private religious faith and the use of the state is where -- for the most personal decisions in American life -- that's where I draw the line.
Thank you.
Now, Mr. President, rebuttal.
Yes, it's very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale.
I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there.
The only attacks I have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side, using the government, using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice of religion.
And they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion.
A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can't do it because it's school property.
These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that.
With regard to a platform on the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that.
I have appointed one member to the Supreme Court: Sandra Day O'Connor.
I'll stand on my record on that.
And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I'll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.
Mr. Mondale, your rebuttal, please.
The platform to which the President refers, in fact, calls for a religious test in the selection of judges.
And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges.
And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life.
Let's take the example that the President cites.
I believe in prayer.
My family prays.
We've never had any difficulty finding time to pray.
But do we want a constitutional amendment adopted of the kind proposed by the President that gets the local politicians into the business of selecting prayers that our children must either recite in school or be embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves?
Who would write the prayer?
What would it say?
How would it be resolved when those disputes occur?
It seems to me that a moment's reflection tells you why the United States Senate turned that amendment down, because it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicizing it.
We don't want that.
Thank you, Mr. Mondale.
Our time is up for this round.
We go into the second round of our questioning, begin again with Jim Wieghart.
Jim?
Political Issues
After that discussion, this may be like going from the sublime to the ridiculous, but here goes.
I have a political question for you, Mr. Mondale.
[Laughter] Polls indicate a massive change in the electorate, away from the coalition that has long made the Democratic Party a majority.
Blue-collar workers, young professionals, their children, and much of the middle class now regard themselves as Independents or Republican instead of Democrats, and the gap -- the edge the Democrats had in party registration seems to be narrowing.
I'd like to ask you, Mr. Mondale, what is causing this?
Is the Democratic Party out of sync with the majority of Americans?
And will it soon be replaced as the majority party by the Republicans?
What do you think needs to be done about it, as a Democrat?
My answer is that this campaign isn't over yet.
And when people vote, I think you're going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that I'm talking about.
The American people want arms control.
They don't want this arms race.
And they don't want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens.
And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world.
The American people see this debt, and they know it's got to come down.
And if it won't come down, the economy's going to slow down, maybe go into a recession.
They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history.
And they know this debt must come down as well, because it's unfair to our children.
The American people want this environment protected.
They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago, and they know that people's lives and health are being risked, because we've had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment.
The American people want their children educated.
They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap that's widening between the United States and Europe and Japan.
The American people want to keep opening doors.
They want those civil rights laws enforced.
They want the equal rights amendment ratified.
They want equal pay for comparable effort for women.
And they want it because they've understood from the beginning that when we open doors, we're all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics.
I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause.
Mr. Mondale, isn't it possible that the American people have heard your message -- and they are listening -- but they are rejecting it?
Well, tonight we had the first debate over the deficit.
The President says it'll disappear automatically.
I've said it's going to take some work.
I think the American people will draw their own conclusions.
Secondly, I've said that I will not support the cuts in Social Security and Medicare and the rest that the President has proposed.
The President answers that it didn't happen or, if it did, it was resolved later in a commission.
As the record develops, I think it's going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength.
Mr. President, you and your party are benefiting from what appears to be an erosion of the old Democratic coalition, but you have not laid out a specific agenda to take this shift beyond November 6th.
What is your program for America for the next decade, with some specificity?
Well, again, I'm running on the record.
I think sometimes Mr. Mondale's running away from his.
But I'm running on the record of what we have asked for.
We'll continue to try to get things that we didn't
