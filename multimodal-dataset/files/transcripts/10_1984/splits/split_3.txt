in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up.
That's why my proposal protects everybody from $25,000 a year or less against any tax increases, and treats those $70,000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a flat tax.
What does this mean in real life?
Well, the other day, Vice President Bush disclosed his tax returns to the American people.
He's one of the wealthiest Americans, and he's our Vice President.
In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes.
In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes.
That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work.
I believe we need some fairness.
And that's why I've proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people who've already got no relief or actually got a tax increase.
It sounds as if you are saying you think this group of taxpayers making 25,000 to 45,000 a year is already overtaxed, yet your tax proposal would increase their taxes.
I think your aides have said those earning about 25,000 to 35,000, their tax rate would go up -- their tax bill would go up a hundred dollars, and from 35,000 to 45,000, more than that, several hundred dollars.
Wouldn't that stifle their incentive to work and invest and so on, and also hurt the recovery?
The first thing is, everybody 25,000 and under would have no tax increase.
Mr. Reagan, after the election, is going to have to propose a tax increase, and you will have to compare what he proposes.
And his Secretary of the Treasury said he's studying a sales tax or a value-added tax.
They're the same thing.
They hit middle- and moderate-income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched.
Up until about $70,000, as you go up the ladder, my proposals will be far more beneficial.
As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, I'd like to see the total repeal of indexing.
I don't think we can do that for a few years.
But at some point, we want to do that as well.
Mr. President, let me try this on you.
Do you think middle-income Americans are overtaxed or undertaxed?
You know, I wasn't going to say this at all, but I can't help it.
There you go again.
[Laughter] I don't have a plan to tax -- or increase taxes.
I'm not going to increase taxes.
I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes.
Now, I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; it's that government is overfed.
And I think that most of our people -- this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up.
And, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those above $50,000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage-wise as did those from 50,000 down.
From 50,000 down, those people paid two-thirds of the taxes, and those people got two-thirds of the tax cut.
Now, the Social Security tax of '77 -- this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest.
It had two features.
It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time -- there are two more yet to come between now and 1989.
At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money -- virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there -- that was subject to that tax.
Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security.
And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20 -- they're paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money.
Now, I don't think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn't work out that way.
The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as I've said, and that has not been changed.
But if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage, yes, you could say, well, that person got 10 times as much as this other person.
Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also.
But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.
I thought I caught, Mr. President, a glimmer of a stronger statement there in your answer than you've made before.
I think the operative position you had before was that you would only raise taxes in a second term as a last resort, and I thought you said flatly that "I'm not going to raise taxes.''
Is that what you meant to say, that you will not -- that you will flatly not raise taxes in your second term as President?
Yes, I had used -- "last resort'' would always be with me.
If you got the Government down to the lowest level, that you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the services for the people, and if the recovery was so complete that you knew you were getting the ultimate amount of revenues that you could get through that growth, and there was still some slight difference there between those two lines, then I had said once that, yes, you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted.
I don't foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence I'm not going to go for a tax.
With regard to assailing Mr. Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there -- had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust.
All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him.
Mr. Mondale, here we go again.
It's time for rebuttal.
Well, first of all, I gave him the benefit of the doubt on the house deal.
I'm just talking about the 12.8 percent that he paid, and that's what's happening all over this country with wealthy Americans.
They've got so many loopholes they don't have to pay much in taxes.
Now, Mr. President, you said, "There you go again,'' right?
Yes.
You remember the last time you said that?
Mm-hmm.
You said it when President Carter said that you were going to cut Medicare, and you said, "Oh, no, there you go again, Mr.
President.''
And what did you do right after the election?
You went out and tried to cut $20 billion out of Medicare.
And so, when you say, "There you go again'' -- people remember this, you know.
[Laughter] And people will remember that you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of California and the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States, and what are you going to do?
You've got a $260 billion deficit.
You can't wish it away.
You won't slow defense spending; you refuse to do that -- --
Mr. Mondale, I'm afraid your time is up.
Sorry.
Mr. President?
Yes.
With regard to Medicare, no, but it's time for us to say that Medicare is in pretty much the same condition that Social Security was, and something is going to have to be done in the next several years to make it fiscally sound.
And, no, I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem.
And maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent.
All right.
Fine.
I gave you back some of that time.
[Laughter]
We can't keep going back for other rebuttals; there'll be time later.
We now go to our final round.
The way things stand now, we have time for only two sets of questions, and by lot, it will be Jim and Diane.
And we'll start with Jim Wieghart.
Social Welfare Programs
Mr. President, the economic recovery is real, but uneven.
The Census Bureau, just a month ago, reported that there are more people living under poverty now, a million more people living under it, than when you took office.
There have been a number of studies, including studies by the Urban Institute and other nonpolitical organizations, that say that the impact of the tax and budget cuts and your economic policies have impacted severely on certain classes of Americans -- working mothers, head of households, minority groups, elderly poor.
In fact, they're saying the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer under your policies.
What relief can you offer to the working poor, to the minorities, and to the women head of households who have borne the brunt of these economic programs?
What can you offer them in the future, in your next term?
Well, some of those facts and figures just don't stand up.
Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here.
It has begun to decline, but it is still going up.
On the other hand, women heads of household -- single women heads of household have -- for the first time there's been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them.
We have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty, it all had to do with their private earnings.
It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs.
We are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980.
We're spending a third more on all of the -- well, all of the programs of human service.
We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before -- 2,300,000 more are receiving them -- even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them.
We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits.
We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy.
Some time ago, Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind.
Half -- one out of two of the full-time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid.
But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans.
We didn't think that was right.
And so, we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college, their family incomes were so low.
So, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have.
7.7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings -- 7.7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over, leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million.
Mr. President, in a visit to Texas -- in Brownsville, I believe it was, in the Rio Grande Valley -- you did observe that the economic recovery was uneven.
Yes.
In that particular area of Texas, unemployment was over 14 percent, whereas statewide, it was the lowest in the country, I believe -- 5.6 percent.
And you made the comment, however, that man does not live by bread alone.
What did you mean by that comment?
And if I interpret it correctly, it would be a comment more addressed to the affluent who obviously can look beyond just the bread they need to sustain them, with their wherewithal.
That had nothing to do with the other thing of talking about their needs or anything.
I remember distinctly, I was segueing into another subject.
I was talking about the things that have been accomplished, and that was referring to the revival of patriotism and optimism, the new spirit that we're finding all over America.
And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people.
So, that was the only place that that was used.
I did avoid, I'm afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes.
There is no way that the recovery is even across the country, just as in the depths of the recession, there were some parts of the country that were worse off, but some that didn't even feel the pain of the recession.
We're not going to rest and not going to be happy until every person in this country who wants a job can have one, until the recovery is complete across the country.
Mr. Mondale, as you can gather from the question to the President, the celebrated War on Poverty obviously didn't end the problem of poverty, although it may have dented it.
The poor and the homeless and the disadvantaged are still with us.
What should the Federal Government's role be to turn back the growth in the number of people living below the poverty level, which is now 35 million in the United States, and to help deal with the structural unemployment problems that the President was referring to in an uneven recovery?
Number one, we've got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed.
Number two, we have to work with cities and others to help generate economic growth in those communities -- through the Urban Development Action Grant Program.
I don't mind those enterprise zones; let's try them, but not as a substitute for the others.
Certainly education and training is crucial.
If these young Americans don't have the skills that make them attractive to employees, they're not going to get jobs.
The next thing is to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minorities so that these businesses are located in the communities in which they're found.
The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth.
There is no question that the poor are worse off.
I think the President genuinely believes that they're better off.
But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago.
How you can cut school lunches, how you can cut student assistance, how you can cut housing, how you can cut disability benefits, how you can do all of these things and then the people receiving them -- for example, the disabled, who have no alternative -- how they're going to do better, I don't know.
Now, we need a tight budget, but there's no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and they're hurting.
One final point if I might.
There's another part of the lopsided economy that we're in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports.
We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year.
That's another reason to get the deficit down.
Mr. Mondale, is it possible that the vast majority of Americans who appear to be prosperous have lost interest in the kinds of programs you're discussing to help those less privileged than they are?
I think the American people want to make certain that that dollar is wisely spent.
I think they stand for civil rights.
I know they're all for education in science and training, which I strongly support.
They want these young people to have a chance to get jobs and the rest.
I think the business community wants to get involved.
I think they're asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved.
I think that's part of it.
I think also that the American people want a balanced program that gives us long-term growth so that they're not having to take money that's desperate to themselves and their families and give it to someone else.
I'm opposed to that, too.
And now it is time for our rebuttal for this period.
Mr. President?
Yes.
The connection that's been made again between the deficit and the interest rates -- there is no connection between them.
There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter-Mondale budget that we inherited -- that the interest rates came down from 21\1/2\, down toward the 12 or 13 figure.
And while they were coming down, the deficits had started their great increase.
They were going up.
Now, if there was a connection I think that there would be a different parallel between deficits getting larger and interest rates going down.
The interest rates are based on inflation.
And right now I have to tell you I don't think there is any excuse for the interest rates being as high as they are because we have brought inflation down so low.
I think it can only be that they're anticipating or hope -- expecting, not hoping, that maybe we don't have a control of inflation and it's going to go back up again.
Well, it isn't going to go back up.
We're going to see that it doesn't.
And I haven't got time to answer with regard to the disabled.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Mr. President, if I heard you correctly, you said that these deficits don't have anything to do with interest rates.
I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate as to why -- energy prices and so on.
There's no way of glossing around that.
But when these huge deficits went in place in 1981,
