would you support or sign, as president, a federal law banning racial profiling by police and other authorities at all levels of government?
Yes, I would.
The only thing an executive order can accomplish is to ban it in federal law enforcement agencies, but I would also support a law in the Congress that would have the effect of doing the same thing.
I just -- I think that racial profiling is a serious problem.
I remember when the stories first came out about the stops in New Jersey by the highway patrol there.
And I know it's been going on a long time.
In some ways this is just a new label for something that has been going on for years.
But I have to confess that it was the first time that I really focused on it in a new way.
And I was surprised at the extent of it.
And I think we've now got so many examples around the country that we really have to find ways to end this.
Imagine what it -- what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly, unjustly, and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity.
Now, that runs counter to what the United States of America is all about at our core.
And it's not an easy problem to solve.
But if I am entrusted with the presidency, it will be the first Civil Rights Act of the 21st century.
Yeah, I can't imagine what it would be like to be singled out because of race and stopped and harassed.
That's just flat wrong, and that's not what America is all about.
And so we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling.
One of my concerns, though, is I don't want to federalize the local police forces.
I want to -- obviously in the egregious cases we need to enforce civil rights law, but we need to make sure that internal affairs divisions at the local level do their job and be given a chance to do their job.
I believe in local control of governments, and obviously if they don't there needs to be a consequence at the federal level.
But it's very important that we not overstep our bounds and I think most people -- most police officers are good, dedicated, honorable citizens who are doing their job, putting their lives at risk who aren't bigoted or aren't prejudiced.
I don't think they ought to be held guilty.
But I do think we need to find out where racial profiling occurs and do something about it and say to the local folks, get it done.
And if you can't, there will be a federal consequence.
And that could be a federal law?
Yeah.
And you would agree?
I would agree.
And I also agree that most police officers, of course, are doing a good job and hate this practice also.
I talked to an African-American police officer in Springfield, Massachusetts not long ago who raised this question and said that in his opinion one of the biggest solutions is in the training.
And not only the training in police procedures, but human relations.
And I think that racial profiling is part of a larger issue of how we deal with race in America.
And as for singling people out because of race, you know, James Byrd was singled out because of his race in Texas.
And other Americans have been singled out because of their race or ethnicity.
And that's why I think we can embody our values by passing a hate crimes law.
I think these crimes are different.
I think they're different because they're based on prejudice and hatred, which gives rise to crimes that have not just a single victim, but they're intended to stigmatize and dehumanize a whole group of people.
You have a different view of that.
No, I don't, really.
On hate crimes laws?
No.
We've got one in Texas.
And guess what?
The three men who murdered James Byrd, guess what's going to happen to them?
They're going to be put to death.
A jury found them guilty.
It's going to be hard to punish them any worse after they get put to death.
And it's the right cause.
It's the right decision.
Secondly, there is other forms of racial profiling that goes on in America.
Arab-Americans are racially profiled in what is called secret evidence.
People are stopped, and we have to do something about that.
My friend, Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, is pushing a law to make sure that Arab-Americans are treated with respect.
So racial profiling isn't just an issue at local police forces.
It's an issue throughout our society.
And as we become a diverse society, we're going to have to deal with it more and more.
I believe, though -- I believe, as sure as I'm sitting here, that most Americans really care.
They're tolerant people.
They're good, tolerant people.
It's the very few that create most of the crises, and we just have to find them and deal with them.
What -- if you become president, Governor, are there other areas, racial problem areas, that you would deal with as president involving discrimination?
Like you said, Arab-Americans, but also Hispanics, Asians, as well as Blacks in this country.
Let me tell you where the biggest discrimination comes.
In public education when we just move children through the schools.
My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here.
She had one of the greatest lines of all lines.
She said, reading is the new civil right.
She's right.
And to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in America must be educated.
I mean every child.
It starts with making sure every child learns to read.
K-2 diagnostic testing so we know whether or not there's a deficiency.
Curriculum that works and phonics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum.
Intensive reading laboratories, teacher retraining.
I mean, there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling, which is illiterate children.
We can do better in our public schools.
We can close an achievement gap, and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability, Jim.
One of the cornerstones of reform, and good reform, is to measure.
Because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know?
Is anybody being profiled?
Is anybody being discriminated against?
It becomes a tool, a corrective tool.
And I believe the federal government must say that if you receive any money, any money from the federal government for disadvantaged children, for example, you must show us whether or not the children are learning.
And if they are, fine.
And if they're not, there has to be a consequence.
And so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education.
There is nothing more prejudiced than not educating a child.
Vice President Gore, what would be on your racial discrimination elimination list as president?
Well, I think we need tough enforcement of the civil rights laws.
I think we still need affirmative action.
I would pass a hate crimes law, as I said, and I guess I had misunderstood the governor's previous position.
The Byrd family may have a misunderstanding of it in Texas also.
But I would like to shift, if I could, to the big issue of education.
Hold on one second.
What is the misunderstanding?
Let's clear this up.
Well, I had thought that there was a controversy at the end of the legislative session where the hate crimes law in Texas was -- failed, and that the Byrd family, among others, asked you to support it, Governor, and it died in committee for lack of support.
Am I wrong about that?
Well, you don't realize we have a hate crimes statute?
We do.
I'm talking about the one that was proposed to deal --
No -- well, what the Vice President must not understand is we've got a hate crimes bill in Texas.
And secondly, the people that murdered Mr. Byrd got the ultimate punishment.
The death penalty.
They were prosecuted under the murder laws, were they not, in Texas?
In this case when you murder somebody it's hate, Jim.
The crime is hate.
And they got the ultimate punishment.
I'm not exactly sure how you enhance the penalty any more than the death penalty.
We happen to have a statute on the books that's a hate crimes statute in Texas.
May I respond?
Sure.
I don't want to jump in.
I may have been misled by all the news reports about this matter, because the law that was proposed in Texas that had the support of the Byrd family and a whole lot of people in Texas did, in fact, die in committee.
There may be some other statute that was already on the books, but certainly the advocates of the hate crimes law felt that a tough new law was needed.
And it's important, Jim, not only -- not just because of Texas, but because this mirrors the national controversy.
There is pending now in the Congress a national hate crimes law because of James Byrd, because of Matthew Shepard, who was crucified on a split rail fence by bigots, and because of others.
And that law has died in committee also because of the same kind of opposition.
And you would support that bill.
Absolutely.
Would you support a national hate crimes law?
I would support the Orrin Hatch version of it, not the Senator Kennedy version.
But let me say to you, Mr. Vice President, we're happy with our laws on our books.
That bill did -- there was another bill that did die in committee.
But I want to repeat, if you have a state that fully supports the law like we do in Texas, we're going to go after all crime.
And we're going to make sure people get punished for the crime.
And in this case we can't enhance the penalty any more than putting those three thugs to death.
And that's what's gonna happen in the State of Texas.
New subject, new question.
Another vice presidential debate follow-up.
Governor, both Senator Lieberman and Secretary Cheney said they were sympathetically rethinking their views on same sex relationships.
What's your position on that?
I'm not for gay marriage.
I think marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman.
And I appreciated the way the administration signed the Defense of Marriage Act.
I presume the Vice President supported it when the President signed that bill and supports it now.
But I think marriage is a sacred institution.
I'm going to be respectful for people who may disagree with me.
I've had a record of doing so in the State of Texas.
I've been a person that had been called a uniter, not a divider, because I accept other people's points of view.
But I feel strongly that marriage should be between a man and a woman.
Vice President Gore?
I agree with that, and I did support that law.
But I think that we should find a way to allow some kind of civic unions, and I basically agree with Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman.
And I think the three of us have one view and the Governor has another view.
Is that right?
I'm not sure what kind of view he's describing to me.
I can just tell you, I'm a person who respects other people.
I respect their -- I respect -- on the one hand he says he agrees with me and then he says he doesn't.
I'm not sure where he's coming from.
But I will be a tolerant person.
I've been a tolerant person all my life.
I just happen to believe strongly that marriage is between a man and a woman.
Do you believe in general terms that gays and lesbians should have the same rights as other Americans?
Yes.
I don't think they ought to have special rights, but I think they ought to have the same rights.
Well, there's a law pending called the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.
I strongly support it.
What it says is that gays and lesbians can't be fired from their job because they're gay or lesbian.
And it would be a federal law preventing that.
Now, I wonder if the -- it's been blocked by the opponents in the majority in the Congress.
I wonder if the Governor would lend his support to that law.
Governor?
The question --
Well, but it's a logical response.
Well, I have no idea.
I mean, he can throw out all kinds -- I don't know the particulars of this law.
I will tell you I'm the kind of person, I don't hire or fire somebody based upon their sexual orientation.
As a matter of fact, I would like to take the issue a little further.
I don't really think it's any of my -- you know, any of my concerns what -- how you conduct your sex life.
And I think that's a private matter.
And I think that's the way it ought to be.
But I'm going to be respectful for people, I'll tolerate people, and I support equal rights but not special rights for people.
Special rights, how does that affect gays and lesbians?
Well, it would be if they're given special protective status.
That doesn't mean we shouldn't fully enforce laws and fully protect people and fully honor people, which I will do as the President of the United States.
New subject, new question, Vice President Gore.
How do you see the connection between controlling gun sales in this country and the incidence of death by accidental or intentional use of guns?
Jim, I hope that we can come back to the subject of education because the governor made an extensive statement on it and I have a very different view than the one he expressed.
But that having been said, I believe that -- well, first of all, let me say that the governor and I agree on some things where this subject is concerned.
I will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen.
I think that homeowners have to be respected and their right to have a gun if they wish to.
The problem I see is that there are too many guns getting into the hands of children, and criminals, and people who, for whatever reason, some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get guns.
I think these assault weapons are a problem.
So I favor closing the gun show loophole.
In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives went the other way.
That's still pending.
If we could get agreement on that, maybe they could pass that in the final days of this Congress.
I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady Law.
I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively.
Some of the restrictions that have been placed by the Congress in the last couple of years.
I think -- in the last few years I think have been unfortunate.
I think that we ought to make all schools gun free.
Have a gun-free zone around every school in this country.
I think that measures like these are important.
Child safety trigger locks on a mandatory basis, and others.
Governor?
Well, it starts with enforcing law.
When you say loud and clear to somebody if you're going to carry a gun illegally, we're going to arrest you.
If you're going to sell a gun illegally, you need to be arrested.
If you commit a crime with a gun, there needs to be absolute certainty in the law.
And that means that the local law enforcement officials need help at the federal level.
Programs like Project Exile where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns.
And we haven't done a very good job of that at the federal level recently.
And I'm going to make it a priority.
Secondly, I don't think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn't have them.
That's why I support instant background checks at gun shows.
One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not.
In Texas I tried to do something innovative.
There's a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future.
I support that.
But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free.
So we're distributing in our State of Texas for free.
I think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21.
I disagree with the vice president on this issue.
He is for registration of guns.
I think the only people that are going to show up to register or get a license -- I guess licensing like a driver's license for a gun, the only people that are going to show up are law-abiding citizens.
The criminal is not going to show up and say hey, give me my I.D.
card.
It's the law-abiding citizens who will do that.
An I don't think that is going to be an effective tool to make the -- keep our society safe.
All right.
So on guns, somebody wants to cast a vote based on your differences, where are the differences?
Well, I'm not for registration.
I am for licensing by states of new handgun purchases.
What's that mean?
A photo license I.D.
like a driver's license for new handguns and, you know, the Los Angeles --
Excuse me, you would have to get the license -- a photo I.D.
to go in and before you could buy the gun?
Correct.
All right.
Who would issue the --
The state.
The state.
I think states should do that for new handguns, because too many criminals are getting guns.
There was a recent investigation of the number in Texas who got -- who were given concealed weapons permits in spite of the fact that they had records.
And the "Los Angeles Times" spent a lot of ink going into that.
But I am not for doing anything that would affect hunters or sportsmen, rifles, shotguns, existing handguns.
I do think that sensible gun safety measures are warranted now.
Look, this is the year -- this is in the aftermath of Columbine, and Paducah, and all the places in our country where the nation has been shocked by these weapons in the hands of the wrong people.
The woman who bought the guns for the two boys who did that killing at Columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there, she would not have bought those guns.
That conceivably could have prevented that tragedy.
Back to the question about the differences on gun control.
What are they, Governor, from your point of view, between you and the Vice President?
Well, I'm not for photo licensing.
Let me say something about Columbine.
Listen, we've got gun laws.
He says we ought to have gun-free schools.
Everybody believes that.
I'm sure every state in the union has got them.
You can't carry a gun into a school.
And there ought to be a consequence when you do carry a gun into a school.
But Columbine spoke to a larger issue.
It's really a matter of culture.
It's a culture that somewhere along the line we've begun to disrespect life.
Where a child can walk in and have their heart turned dark as a result of being on the Internet and walk in and decide to take somebody else's life?
So gun laws are important, no question about it, but so is loving children, and character education classes, and faith-based programs being a part of after-school programs.
Some desperate child needs to have somebody put their arm around them and say, we love you.
So there's a -- this is a society that -- of ours that's got to do a better job of teaching children right from wrong.
And we can enforce law.
But there seems to be a lot of preoccupation on -- not certainly only in this debate, but just in general on law.
But there's a larger law.
Love your neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself.
And that's where our society must head if we're going to be a peaceful and prosperous society.
I also believe in the Golden Rule.
And I agree with a lot of the other things that the governor has said.
We do have a serious problem in our culture.
Tipper and I have worked on the problem of violence in entertainment aimed at children.
She's worked on it longer than I have.
