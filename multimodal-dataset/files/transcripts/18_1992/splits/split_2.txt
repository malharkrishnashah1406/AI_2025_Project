the things that he fears most might not be all that dangerous, according to some scientists.
You know, you can overdo, I'm told, environmental cleaning up.
If you purify the pond, the water lilies die.
You know, I love this planet and I want it to stay here, but I don't like to have it the private property of fanatics that want to overdo this thing.
(APPLAUSE)
Senator Gore.
Bill Clinton and I believe we can create millions of new jobs by leading the environmental revolution instead of dragging our feet and bringing up the rear.
You know, Japan and Germany are both opening proclaiming to the world now that the biggest new market in the history of world business is the market for the new products and technologies that foster economic progress without environmental destruction.
Why is the Japanese business organization -- the largest one they have, the Ki Den Ren (phonetic), arguing for tougher environmental standards than those embodied in US law?
Why is MITI -- their trade organization -- calling on all Japanese corporations everywhere in the world to exceed by as much as possible the environmental standards of every country in which they're operating?
Well, maybe they're just dumb about business competition.
But maybe they know something that George Bush and Dan Quayle don't know -- that the future will call for greater efficiency and greater environmental efficiency.
This is a value an issue that touches my basic values.
I'm taught in my religious tradition that we are given dominion over the Earth, but we're required to be good stewards of the Earth, and that means to take care of it.
We're not doing that now under the Bush-Quayle policies.
They have gutted the Clean Air Act.
They have broken his pledge to be the environmental president.
Bill Clinton and I will change that.
(APPLAUSE)
Okay.
Discussion period now.
Again, leave time for each other, please.
Vice President Quayle, go ahead.
Well, I'm tempted to yield to Admiral Stockdale on this.
But I -- you know, the fact of the matter is that one of the proposals that Senator Gore has suggested is to have the taxpayers of America spend $100 billion a year on environmental projects in foreign countries --
That's not true --
Foreign aid -- well, Senator, it's in your book.
On page 304 --
No, it's not.
It is there.
(APPLAUSE)  It is in your book.
You know, Hal, I wanted to bring the Gore book tonight, because I figured he was going to pull a Bill Clinton on me and he has.
Because he's going to disavow what's in his book.
It's in your book --
No.
It comes out to $100 billion of foreign aid for environmental projects.
All right.
Let's give him a chance to answer.
Now, how are we going to pay for it?
How are we going to pay for an extra $100 billion of the taxpayers' money for this?
Dan, I appreciate you reading my book very much, but you've got it wrong.
No, I've got it right.
There's no such proposal.
Okay, well, we'll find --
Let him talk, Mr Vice President.
Let the senator talk.
Go ahead.
There is no such proposal.
What I have called upon is a cooperative effort by the US and Europe and Asia to work together in opening up new markets throughout the world for the new technologies that are necessary in order to reconcile the imperatives of economic progress with the imperatives of environmental protection.
Take Mexico City for an example.
They are shutting down factories right now, not because of their economy, but because they're choking to death on the air pollution.
They're banning automobiles some days of the week.
Now what they want is not new laser-guided missile systems.
What they want are new engines and new factories and new products that don't pollute the air and the water, but nevertheless allow them to have a decent standard of living for their people.
Last year 35 % of our exports went to developing countries, countries where the population is expanding worldwide by as much as one billion people every ten years.
We cannot stick our heads in the sand and pretend that we don't face a global environmental crisis, nor should we assume that it's going to cost jobs.
Quite the contrary.
We are going to be able to create jobs as Japan and Germany are planning to do right now, if we have the guts to leave.
Now earlier we heard about the auto industry and the timber industry.
There have been 250,000 jobs lost in the automobile industry during the Reagan-Bush-Quayle years.
There have been tens of thousands of jobs lost in the timber industry.
What they like to do is point the finger of blame with one hand and hand out pink slips with the other hand.
They've done a poor job both with the economy and the environment.
(APPLAUSE.)
It's time for a change.
(APPLAUSE.)
Admiral Stockdale, you had something you wanted to say here?
I know that -- I read where Senator Gore's mentor had disagree with some of the scientific data that is in his book.
How do you respond to those criticisms of that sort?
Do you --
Deny it.
Well -- (Laughter.)
Do you take this into account?
(Laughter.)
No, I -- let me respond.
Thank you, Admiral, for saying that.
You're talking about Roger Revelle.
His family wrote a lengthy letter saying how terribly he had been misquoted and had his remarks taken completely out of context just before he died.
(Jeers.)
He believed up until the day he died -- no, it's true, he died last year --
I'd ask the audience to stop, please.
-- and just before he died, he co- authored an article which was -- had statements taken completely out of context.
In fact the vast majority of the world's scientists -- and they have worked on this extensively -- believe that we must have an effort to face up to the problems we face with the environment.
And if we just stick out heads in the sand and pretend that it's not real, we're not doing ourselves a favor.
Even worse than that, we're telling our children and all future generations that we weren't willing to face up to this obligation.
Hal, can I --
I believe that we have a mandate --
Sure.
We've still got time.
-- to try to solve this problem, particularly when we can do it while we create jobs in the process.
Go ahead, Mr. Vice President, there's still time.
Not much, though.
I know it.
We've got to have a little equal time here now, Hal.
In the book you also suggest taxes on gasoline, taxes on utilities, taxes on carbon, taxes on timber.
There's a whole host of taxes.
And I don't just -- I don't believe raising taxes is the way to solve our environmental problems.
And you talk about the bad situation in the auto industry.
You seem to say that the answer is, well, I'll just make it that much worse by increasing the CAFE standards.
Yes, the auto industry is hurting, it's been hurting for a long time, and increasing the CAFE standards to 45 miles per gallon, like you and Bill Clinton are suggesting, will put, as I said, 300,000 people out of work.
Okay, let's move on now.
I would like to remind the audience of one thing.
Trying to stop you from applauding may be a lost cause.
I didn't say anything about hissing, but I do think it is discourteous, and there's no call for that, and it reflects badly on the candidate you're supporting.
So let's knock that off.
Let's go on to health care.
Health care protection has become a necessity of life in our society, yet millions of Americans are not ensured and the cost of medical treatment is practically out of control.
How do you propose to control these costs and how are you going to provide access to health care for every American?
Let's see, whose turn is it to go now?
I think it's Admiral Stockdale's.
I think it's Admiral Stockdale's turn to go first.
Go ahead, sir.
Well, we have excellent technical health care, but we don't administer it very well, and the escalating costs top any other budget danger in the -- on the horizon, I think.
And what Mr Perot has suggested is that we try to re- -to look at the incentives, the incentives that are in our current way of doing business, are what are killing us.
There's -- there's no incentive for a hypochondriac not to go to the -- to Medicare every day.
There is no incentive for a doctor to curtail the expensive tests because he's under threat of malpractice lawyers.
And so we -- we just have a web of wrong-way incentives that has to be changed by some people who are in the medical profession and some other crafty people who know how to write contracts to change incentives or get -- get the -- the incentives situation under control.
Senator Gore.
Bill Clinton and I believe that if a criminal has the right to a lawyer, every American family ought to have the right to see a doctor of their own choosing when they need to see a doctor.
There are almost 40 million Americans who work full time today and yet have no health insurance whatsoever.
We are proposing to change that, not with a government-run plan, not with new taxes, but with a new approach called managed competition.
We are going to provide a standard health insurance package provided by private insurance companies and eliminate the duplication and red tape, and overlap, and we're going to have cost controls to eliminate the unnecessary procedures that are costing so much money today.
There was a bipartisan commission evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats who looked at our plan and the Bush-Quayle proposal.
They said ours will save tens of billions of dollars and cover every American.
The Bush proposal, by contrast, will cost us tens of billions and still leave Americans uninsured.
But what I want to know is, why has George Bush waited for 3 and a half years during this health insurance crisis before finally coming out with a proposal, just before the election, and he still hasn't introduced it in Congress.
Why the long wait, Dan?
Mr Vice President.
Hal, President Bush has had his health care reform agenda on Capitol Hill for 8 months.
He's had parts of it up there for years.
You talk about increasing costs that the president has had on Capitol Hill- - medical malpractice reform legislation -- for several years.
Defensive medicine and health care today cost $20.7 billion.
Defense medicine defined as testing and treatment that is only necessary in case of a law suit.
Wouldn't that be nice to take $20.7 billion that we're putting into our legal system and put it to preventive health care or women's health care or something else besides trial lawyers?
But no -- you don't want to reform the health care system to drive down costs through medical malpractice.
What you're doing -- you are talking about a government program.
Your program is to ration health care.
You said in your statement to see a doctor when you want to see a doctor.
When you start rationing health care there's going to be a waiting line to see a doctor unless it's an emergency.
Remember when we rationed energy in this country?
Waiting lines at the gasoline stations.
The same thing would happen when you ration health care.
The president's proposal deals with tax credits, deductions and purchasing health care in the private sector and making health care affordable and available to every single American.
Admiral Stockdale, would you like to start the discussion period?
Well, I'm out of ammunition on this --
Well, let me talk then because I've got a couple of things that I want to say.
Go ahead, Senator.
We still didn't get an answer to the question of why George Bush waited for 3 and a half years --
He didn't wait 3 and a half years.
-- during the national --
I did answer the question.
-- health insurance crisis before he even made a proposal.
And it still hasn't been submitted to Congress in the form of legislation.
I also want to respond to the question about malpractice.
Do you know which state has the lowest malpractice premiums in the entire country?
Bill Clinton's Arkansas does -- partly because he has passed reform measures limiting the time during which malpractice suits can be filed.
In fact, tort claims generally have fallen 10 % under Bill Clinton there.
But you know, that's not the reason for this health insurance crisis.
The reason is, we've had absolutely no leadership.
Let me tell you about a friend of mine named Mitch Philpot from Marietta, Georgia -- not far from here -- who Tipper and I met with his family in Johns Hopkins Hospital.
Their son, Brett, was in the bed next to our son and they couldn't pay their medical bills.
They used to live in Atlanta, but they lost their house.
And while they were there, both Mitch and his wife lost their jobs because they could not get unpaid leave.
We pass legislation to give family leave under circumstances like that, exempting small business.
How can you talk about family values, Dan, and twice veto the Family Medical Leave Act?
(APPLAUSE)
Mr Vice President.
Pass our Family Leave Act, because it goes to small businesses where the major problem is.
Your proposal excluded small business.
That's the problem.
Now, let me talk about health care and --
Did you require it?
Did you require it?
My turn -- (holding hand up at Gore)
Did you require (inaudible) -- (Simultaneous conversation)
Lightenâ€™ up Al.
My turn.
It's a free discussion.
Take a breath, Al.
Inhale.
It's a free discussion.
(APPLAUSE)  Did you require family leave in that legislation?
Yes or no?
We offered incentives to small businesses.
Yes or no --
That's a no, isn't it?
Was small business exempted under your proposal?
Yes.
Yes.
And that's where the biggest problem is --
Did you require it of anyone?
I'm going to get back to the topic again --
Did you require it of anyone?
-- because he obviously doesn't want to talk about health insurance or health care, which you address.
I was absolutely -- I shouldn't say that -- another Clinton.
You pulled another Clinton on me because here you go again.
Medical malpractice legislation has been before the Congress of the US and you tried to convince the American people that Bill Clinton is for tort reform?
The biggest campaign contributors to your campaign are the trial lawyers of America.
We have a letter -- and we're going to release it again to the media, if the media is interested -- where the head of the trial lawyers of Arkansas said that Bill Clinton was basically in their back pocket, that Bill Clinton has always opposed tort reform of any kind.
It's in the letter, we have it, we'll make it available -- because Bill Clinton is not for tort reform.
I'd like to know where Bill Clinton stands on health insurance.
When he was campaigning in New Hampshire, he said I am for the pay-or-play health insurance.
Pay or play, that's a 7 to 9 % payroll tax on every worker in America that participates in this program.
Can I respond?
And then, all of a sudden, this summer he says, oh, I'm not for a pay or play.
Here we go again.
Bill Clinton, one day he's for pay or play, the next day he's against pay or play.
He does it in education.
He writes Polly Williams, a Democrat state legislator in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, saying I'm for choice in education; then he goes to the NEA teachers union and says, sorry, I'm not for choice in education because you won't let me be for choice in education.
One time Bill Clinton says term limits -- we ought to limit terms, it's ridiculous that a member of Congress can serve for 30, 40, 50 years, and you limit the terms of the president -- but that's another subject.
We're fixing to limit one.
(Laughter)
It's not going to be mine; it's going to be people like you and Kennedy and Metzenbaum and George Mitchell and the rest of that Democratic Congress on Capitol Hill -- that's who we're talking about.
(APPLAUSE)  And that's who the American people -- as you well know, you've got term limits for a president, you don't have term limits for Congress, and I think it's absolutely ridiculous that we don't.
I want to respond to some of this.
Here goes Bill Clinton again: he says, well, term limits, that's an interesting idea, I think I might be in favor of that.
Then his Democratic friends in Congress say, no, Bill, you can't be for that.
Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth.
You have to tell the truth.
I want to respond, if I might.
Go ahead, Senator, quickly.
You know, in response to my question before that long laundry list, he said that they had their own family leave proposal.
It was just like the proposal of your party back when Social Security was first proposed.
You said: we're for it as long as it's voluntary.
Same with Medicare.
You said: we're for it so long as it's voluntary.
Civil rights -- we're for it so long as it's voluntary.
Senator, I'm going to have to ask you to wrap this one up.
Family leave is important enough to be required.
(APPLAUSE)
Okay, thanks.
Coming out of health care, again trying to avoid controversy, let's talk about the abortion debate.
(Laughter)  Abortion rights has been a bitter controversy in this country for almost 20 years.
It's been heightened by the recent Supreme Court decisions.
So I'll make it very simple in this question: Where do each of you stand on the issue?
What actions will your president's administration take on the abortion question?
Will it be a factor in the appointment of federal judges, especially to the Supreme Court?
And I believe that Senator Gore goes first.
Bill Clinton and I support the right of a woman to choose.
(APPLAUSE)  That doesn't mean we're pro-abortion; in fact, we believe there are way too many abortions in this country.
And the way to reduce them is by reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies, not vetoing family planning legislation the way George Bush has consistently done.
The reason we are pro-choice and in favor of a woman's right to privacy is because we believe that during the early stages of a pregnancy the government has no business coming in and ordering a woman to do what the government thinks is best.
What Dan Quayle and George Bush and Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson think is the right decision in a given set of circumstances is their privilege -- but don't have the government order a woman to do what they think is the right thing to do.
We ought to be able to build more common ground among those who describe themselves as pro-choice and pro-life in efforts to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies.
But, Dan, you can clear this up very simply by repeating after me: I support the right of a woman to choose.
Can you say that?
Vice President Quayle, your turn.
This issue is an issue that divides Americans deeply.
I happen to be pro-life.
I have been pro-life for my 16 years -- (APPLAUSE.)
-- in public life.
My objective and the president's objective is to try to reduce abortions in this country.
We have 1.6 million abortions.
We have more abortions in Washington, DC, than we do live births.
Why shouldn't we have more
