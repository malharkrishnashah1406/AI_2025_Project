are waiting in line, obeying the law to make sure that they can come here and contribute to our country and that's good for our economic growth.
They'll start new businesses.
They'll make things happen to create jobs here in the United States.
Number two, we do have to deal with our border so we put more border patrol on the -- any time in history and the flow of undocumented works across the border is actually lower than it's been in 40 years.
What I've also said is if we're going to go after folks who are here illegally, we should do it smartly and go after folks who are criminals, gang bangers, people who are hurting the community, not after students, not after folks who are here just because they're trying to figure out how to feed their families.
And that's what we've done.
And what I've also said is for young people who come here, brought here often times by their parents.
Had gone to school here, pledged allegiance to the flag.
Think of this as their country.
Understand themselves as Americans in every way except having papers.
And we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship.
And that's what I've done administratively.
Now, Governor Romney just said, you know he wants to help those young people too, but during the Republican primary, he said, "I will veto the DREAM Act", that would allow these young people to have access."
His main strategy during the Republican primary was to say, "We're going to encourage self-deportation."
Making life so miserable on folks that they'll leave.
He called the Arizona law a model for the nation.
Part of the Arizona law said that law enforcement officers could stop folks because they suspected maybe they looked like they might be undocumented workers and check their papers.
You know what?
If my daughter or yours looks to somebody like they're not a citizen, I don't want -- I don't want to empower somebody like that.
So, we can fix this system in a comprehensive way.
And when Governor Romney says, the challenge is, "Well Obama didn't try."
That's not true.
I have sat down with Democrats and Republicans at the beginning of my term.
And I said, let's fix this system.
Including Senators previously who had supported it on the Republican side.
But it's very hard for Republican's in Congress to support comprehensive immigration reform, if their standard bearer has said that, this is not something I'm interested in supporting.
Let me get the governor in here, Mr. President.
Let's speak to, if you could...
Yes.
...the idea of self-deportation?
No, let -- let -- let me go back and speak to the points that the president made and -- and -- and let's get them correct.
I did not say that the Arizona law was a model for the nation in that aspect.
I said that the E-Verify portion of the Arizona law, which is -- which is the portion of the law which says that employers could be able to determine whether someone is here illegally or not illegally, that that was a model for the nation.
That's number one.
Number two, I asked the president a question I think Hispanics and immigrants all over the nation have asked.
He was asked this on Univision the other day.
Why, when you said you'd filed legislation in your first year didn't you do it?
And he didn't answer.
He -- he doesn't answer that question.
He said the standard bearer wasn't for it.
I'm glad you thought I was a standard bearer four years ago, but I wasn't.
Four years ago you said in your first year you would file legislation.
In his first year, I was just getting -- licking my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right.
I was not the standard bearer.
My -- my view is that this president should have honored his promise to do as he said.
Now, let me mention one other thing, and that is self-deportation says let people make their own choice.
What I was saying is, we're not going to round up 12 million people, undocumented illegals, and take them out of the nation.
Instead let people make their own choice.
And if they -- if they find that -- that they can't get the benefits here that they want and they can't -- and they can't find the job they want, then they'll make a decision to go a place where -- where they have better opportunities.
But I'm not in favor of rounding up people and -- and -- and taking them out of this country.
I am in favor, as the president has said, and I agree with him, which is that if people have committed crimes we got to get them out of this country.
Let me mention something else the president said.
It was a moment ago and I didn't get a chance to, when he was describing Chinese investments and so forth.
Candy?
Hold on a second.
The...
Mr. President, I'm still speaking.
(CROSSTALK)
Mr. President, let me finish.
(CROSSTALK)
I've gotta continue.
(CROSSTALK)
Governor Romney, you can make it short.
See all these people?
They've been waiting for you.
(inaudible) make it short (inaudible).
Just going to make a point.
Any investments I have over the last eight years have been managed by a blind trust.
And I understand they do include investments outside the United States, including in -- in Chinese companies.
Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?
Have you looked at your pension?
I've got to say...
Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?
You know, I -- I don't look at my pension.
It's not as big as yours so it doesn't take as long.
Well, let me give you some advice.
I don't check it that often.
Let me give you some advice.
Look at your pension.
You also have investments in Chinese companies.
You also have investments outside the United States.
You also have investments through a Cayman's trust.
(CROSSTALK)
We're way off topic here, Governor Romney.
(CROSSTALK)
I thought we were talking about immigration.
(CROSSTALK)
I do want to make sure that...
If I could have you sit down, Governor Romney.
Thank you.
I do want to make sure that -- I do want to make sure that we just understand something.
Governor Romney says he wasn't referring to Arizona as a model for the nation.
His top adviser on immigration is the guy who designed the Arizona law, the entirety of it; not E-Verify, the whole thing.
That's his policy.
And it's a bad policy.
And it won't help us grow.
Look, when we think about immigration, we have to understand there are folks all around the world who still see America as the land of promise.
And they provide us energy and they provide us innovation and they start companies like Intel and Google.
And we want to encourage that.
Now, we've got to make sure that we do it in a smart way and a comprehensive way, and we make the legal system better.
But when we make this into a divisive political issue, and when we don't have bipartisan support -- I can deliver, Governor, a whole bunch of Democrats to get comprehensive immigration reform done, and we can't...
I'll get it done.
I'll get it done.
First year...
... we can't -- we have not seen Republicans serious about this issue at all.
And it's time for them to get serious on it.
Mr. President, let me move you on here please.
Mr. President, (inaudible).
This used to be a bipartisan issue.
(CROSSTALK)
Don't go away, though -- right.
Don't go away because I -- I want you to talk to Kerry Ladka who wants to switch the topic for us.
OK. Hi, Kerry.
Good evening, Mr. President.
I'm sorry.
What's your name?
It's Kerry, Kerry Ladka.
Great to see you.
This question actually comes from a brain trust of my friends at Global Telecom Supply (ph) in Minneola yesterday.
Ah.
We were sitting around, talking about Libya, and we were reading and became aware of reports that the State Department refused extra security for our embassy in Benghazi, Libya, prior to the attacks that killed four Americans.
Who was it that denied enhanced security and why?
Well, let me first of all talk about our diplomats, because they serve all around the world and do an incredible job in a very dangerous situation.
And these aren't just representatives of the United States, they are my representatives.
I send them there, oftentimes into harm's way.
I know these folks and I know their families.
So nobody is more concerned about their safety and security than I am.
So as soon as we found out that the Benghazi consulate was being overrun, I was on the phone with my national security team and I gave them three instructions.
Number one, beef up our security and procedures, not just in Libya, but at every embassy and consulate in the region.
Number two, investigate exactly what happened, regardless of where the facts lead us, to make sure folks are held accountable and it doesn't happen again.
And number three, we are going to find out who did this and we're going to hunt them down, because one of the things that I've said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them.
Now Governor Romney had a very different response.
While we were still dealing with our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney put out a press release, trying to make political points, and that's not how a commander in chief operates.
You don't turn national security into a political issue.
Certainly not right when it's happening.
And people -- not everybody agrees with some of the decisions I've made.
But when it comes to our national security, I mean what I say.
I said I'd end the war in Libya -- in -- in Iraq, and I did.
I said that we'd go after al-Qaeda and bin Laden, we have.
I said we'd transition out of Afghanistan, and start making sure that Afghans are responsible for their own security, that's what I'm doing.
And when it comes to this issue, when I say that we are going to find out exactly what happened, everybody will be held accountable.
And I am ultimately responsible for what's taking place there because these are my folks, and I'm the one who has to greet those coffins when they come home.
You know that I mean what I say.
Mr. President, I'm going to move us along.
Governor?
Thank you Kerry for your question, it's an important one.
And -- and I -- I think the president just said correctly that the buck does stop at his desk and -- and he takes responsibility for -- for that -- for the failure in providing those security resources, and -- and those terrible things may well happen from time to time.
I -- I'm -- I feel very deeply sympathetic for the families of those who lost loved ones.
And today there's a memorial service for one of those that was lost in this tragedy.
We -- we think of their families and care for them deeply.
There were other issues associated with this -- with this tragedy.
There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration, or actually whether it was a terrorist attack.
And there was no demonstration involved.
It was a terrorist attack and it took a long time for that to be told to the American people.
Whether there was some misleading, or instead whether we just didn't know what happened, you have to ask yourself why didn't we know five days later when the ambassador to the United Nations went on TV to say that this was a demonstration.
How could we have not known?
But I find more troubling than this, that on -- on the day following the assassination of the United States ambassador, the first time that's happened since 1979, when -- when we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didn't know what happened, that the president, the day after that happened, flies to Las Vegas for a political fund-raiser, then the next day to Colorado for another event, other political event.
I think these -- these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that you'd hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses.
We've read their accounts now about what happened.
It was very clear this was not a demonstration.
This was an attack by terrorists.
And this calls into question the president's whole policy in the Middle East.
Look what's happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya.
Consider the distance between ourselves and -- and Israel, the president said that -- that he was going to put daylight between us and Israel.
We have Iran four years closer to a nuclear bomb.
Syria -- Syria's not just a tragedy of 30,000 civilians being killed by a military, but also a strategic -- strategically significant player for America.
The president's policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour and -- and -- and pursue a strategy of leading from behind, and this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes.
Because we're -- we're closing in, I want to still get a lot of people in.
I want to ask you something, Mr. President, and then have the governor just quickly.
Your secretary of state, as I'm sure you know, has said that she takes full responsibility for the attack on the diplomatic mission in Benghazi.
Does the buck stop with your secretary of state as far as what went on here?
Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary job.
But she works for me.
I'm the president and I'm always responsible, and that's why nobody's more interested in finding out exactly what happened than I do.
The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened.
That this was an act of terror and I also said that we're going to hunt down those who committed this crime.
And then a few days later, I was there greeting the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force Base and grieving with the families.
And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the Secretary of State, our U.N.
Ambassador, anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own, governor, is offensive.
That's not what we do.
That's not what I do as president, that's not what I do as Commander in Chief.
Governor, if you want to...
Yes, I -- I...
... quickly to this please.
I -- I think interesting the president just said something which -- which is that on the day after the attack he went into the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror.
That's what I said.
You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack, it was an act of terror.
It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're saying?
Please proceed governor.
I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.
Get the transcript.
It -- it -- it -- he did in fact, sir.
So let me -- let me call it an act of terror...
Can you say that a little louder, Candy?
He -- he did call it an act of terror.
It did as well take -- it did as well take two weeks or so for the whole idea there being a riot out there about this tape to come out.
You are correct about that.
This -- the administration -- the administration indicated this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction.
It did.
It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group.
And to suggest -- am I incorrect in that regard, on Sunday, the -- your secretary --
Candy?
Excuse me.
The ambassador of the United Nations went on the Sunday television shows and spoke about how --
Candy, I'm --
-- this was a spontaneous --
Mr. President, let me --
I'm happy to have a longer conversation --
I know you --
-- about foreign policy.
Absolutely.
But I want to -- I want to move you on and also --
OK.
I'm happy to do that, too.
-- the transcripts and --
I just want to make sure that --
-- figure out what we --
-- all of these wonderful folks are going to have a chance to get some of their questions answered.
Because what I -- what I want to do, Mr. President, stand there a second, because I want to introduce you to Nina Gonzalez, who brought up a question that we hear a lot, both over the Internet and from this crowd.
President Obama, during the Democratic National Convention in 2008, you stated you wanted to keep AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.
What has your administration done or planned to do to limit the availability of assault weapons?
We're a nation that believes in the Second Amendment, and I believe in the Second Amendment.
We've got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and people who want to make sure they can protect themselves.
But there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where I've had to comfort families who have lost somebody.
Most recently out in Aurora.
You know, just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot in that theater.
And her son had been shot through the head.
And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new.
But there were a lot of families who didn't have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn't survive.
So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce the laws we've already got, make sure that we're keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. We've done a much better job in terms of background checks, but we've got more to do when it comes to enforcement.
But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don't belong on our streets.
And so what I'm trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally.
Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced.
But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence.
Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there's an awful lot of violence and they're not using AK-47s.
They're using cheap hand guns.
And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if there's violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control.
And so what I want is a -- is a comprehensive strategy.
Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.
But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur.
Governor Romney, the question is about assault weapons, AK-47s.
Yeah, I'm not in favor of new pieces of legislation on -- on guns and taking guns away or making certain guns illegal.
We, of course, don't want to have automatic weapons, and that's already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons.
What I believe is we have to do, as the president mentioned towards the end of his remarks there, which is to make enormous efforts to enforce the gun laws that we have, and to change the culture of violence that we have.
And you ask how -- how are we going to do that?
And there are a number of things.
He mentioned good schools.
I totally agree.
We were able to drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state.
And I believe if we do a better job in education, we'll -- we'll give people the -- the hope and opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that.
But let me mention another thing.
And that is parents.
We need moms and dads, helping to raise kids.
Wherever possible the -- the benefit of having two parents in the home, and that's not always possible.
A lot of great single moms, single dads.
But gosh to tell our kids that before they have babies, they ought to think about getting married to someone, that's a great idea.
Because if there's a two parent family, the prospect of living in poverty goes down dramatically.
The opportunities that the child will -- will be able to achieve increase dramatically.
So we can make changes in the way our culture works to help bring people away from violence and give them opportunity, and bring them in the American system.
The -- the greatest failure we've had with regards to -- to gun violence in some respects is what --
