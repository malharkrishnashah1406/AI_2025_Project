becomes clear that voluntary means are not working?
Mr. Corddry, I am well aware of the present deficiencies in the Armed Forces of this country.
When you have a report, as we did recently, that six out of 10 CONUS Divisions in this country - Continental United States Army Divisions - simply could not pass a readiness test: that two out of three divisions that were to be allocated to the so-called Rapid Deployment Force could not meet a readiness test.
And in most cases, that failure to meet the test was because of a lack of manning requirements, an inability to fill many of the slots in those divisions.
Yes, I have seen figures that indicate that perhaps as of September, 1980 - this very month - that there is a shortage of about 104,000 in the ranks between E-4 and E-9.
And there were reports.
public reports not long ago about ships that could not leave American ports because of a lack of crews.
I talked to one of the leading former chiefs of Naval operations in my office a few weeks ago, who told me about 25,000 Chief Petty Officers being short.
But, I think that that is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the all-volunteer Army was created in 1973 - and I worked hard for it and supported it - we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living.
And today, on the average, the average serviceman is at least 15% - and I happen to think that's a very modest estimate - 15% below what has happened to the cost of living over that period of time.
And as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today.
And I think that's shocking; it's shameful.
So, yes, I told the American Legion National!
Convention, the VFW National Convention - when I spoke to each of those bodies - I outlined a very specific program of increasing pay and allowances, reenlistment bonuses.
That only makes sense.
But I would leave you with this thought, sir, to be quite specific in my answer to your question: that, of course, to protect the vital interests of this country, if that became impossible; if I could not, despite the very best efforts that I asked the Congress to put forward, to raise those pay and incentives and allowances, of course, I would not leave this country go undefended.
Mr. Corddry?
Mr. Reagan, I will just repeat the two questions: How would you fill the under-strength combat forces with numbers and with quality, without reviving conscription?
And will you commit yourself; here, tonight, should you become the Commander in Chief, to propose a draft, however unpopular, if it becomes clear that voluntary means are not solving our manpower problems?
Mr. Corddry, it's a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement on this particular issue, and the only one who would be disagreeing with us is the President, if he were present.
I. too, believe in the voluntary military.
As a matter of fact, today the shortages of non-commissioned officers that John mentioned are such that if we tried to have a draft today, we wouldn't have the non-commissioned officers to train the draftees.
I believe the answer lies in just recognizing human nature and how we make everything else work in this country, when we want it to work.
Recognize that we have a voluntary military.
We are asking for men and women to join the military as a career, and we're asking them to deal with the most sophisticated of equipment.
And a young man is out there on a $1 billion carrier in charge of the maintenance of a $20 million aircraft, working 100 hours a week at times, and he's earning less for himself and his family, while he's away from his family, than he could earn if he were in one of the most menial jobs, working 40 hours a week here at home.
As an aid to enlistment.
we had an aid - 46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G.I.
Bill of Rights - the fact that, by serving in the military, they could provide for a future college education.
In 1977, we took that away from the military.
That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up.
So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if we're going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heaven's sakes, let's go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that we're asking of them.
Along with this, I think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate.
We need a million-man active reserve that could be called up on an instant's notice, and that would be also trained, ready to use that type of equipment.
Both of these, I think, would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people.
The other day, I just - I'll hasten - I just saw one example.
Down in Texas.
I saw a high school that is military.
Your time is up, Mr. Reagan.
Fine.
I'm sorry.
I'll catch up with it later.
You can finish it after it's over.
Mr. Anderson?
Mr. Moyers.
I must say that I think I have better opportunity, however, of finding the necessary funds to pay what, admittedly, will be very, very substantial sums of money.
We signed one bill.
or we passed one bill, just a couple of weeks ago in the House of Representatives for $500 million - a half a billion dollars.
That is just a downpayment, in my opinion.
But, unlike Governor Reagan, I do not support a boondoggle like the MX missile.
I've just gotten a report from the Air Force that indicates that the 30-year lifecycle cost of that system is going to be $100 billion.
The initial cost is about $54 billion, and then when you add in the additional costs - not only the construction of the system, the missiles and the personnel, and so on - when you add in the additional costs over the lifecycle of that system, over $100 billion.
I would propose to save the taxpayers of this country from that kind of costly boondoggle.
Mr. Reagan?
Well, let me just say that, with regard to that same missile system, I happen to support and believe in the missile, itself.
But that's not the $54 billion cost that John is talking about.
He's talking about that fantastic plan of the Administration to take thousands and thousands of square miles out in the Western states.
And first, he was going to dig a racetrack and have it going around in the racetrack so it would meet the requirements of SALT II treaty, and now he's decided it'll have a straight up and down thing, so it can he both verifiable and yet hideable from the Soviet Union.
We need the missile, I think, because we are so out of balance strategically that we lack a deterrent to a possible first assault.
But I am not in favor of the plan that is so costly.
And therefore, if I only had another second left, I'd say that that high school class in a military training - 40 of its 80 graduates last year entered the United States service academies; West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy, and to see those young men made me very proud to realize that there are young people in this country that are prepared to go into that kind of a career in service of their country.
This question comes to you, Mr. Reagan, from my colleague, Lee May.
Mr. Reagan, the military is not the only area in crisis.
American cities are physically wearing out, as housing, streets, sewers and budgets all fall apart.
And all of this is piled upon the emotional strain that comes from refugees and racial confrontations.
Now, I'm wondering what specific plans do you have for Federal involvement in saving our cities from these physical and emotional!
crises, and how would you carry out those plans in addition to raising military pay, without going against your pledge of fiscal restraint?
I don't think I'd have to go against that pledge.
I think one of the problems today with the cities is Federal aid.
The mayors that I've talked to in some of our leading cities tell!
me that the Federal grants that come with.
for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local government's hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority.
If they had that money without those government restrictions, every one of them has told me they could make great savings and make far greater use of the money.
What I have been advocating is, why don't we start with the Federal Government turning back tax sources to states and local governments, as well as the responsibilities for those programs?
Seventy-five percent of the people live in the cities.
I don't know of a city in America that doesn't have the kind of problems you're talking about.
But, where are we getting the money that the Federal Government is putting out to help them?
New York is being taxed for money that will then go to Detroit.
But Detroit is being taxed for money that, let's say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia.
Wouldn't it make a lot more sense if the government let them keep their own money there in the first place?
But there are other things that we can do with the inner cities, and I've believed.
I have talked of having zones in those cities that are run down, where there is a high percentage of people on welfare, and offer tax incentives.
The government isn't getting a tax now from businesses there because they aren't there, or from individuals who are on welfare rather than working.
And why don't we offer incentives for business and industry to start up in those zones?
Give them a tax moratorium for a period if they build and develop there.
The individuals that would then get jobs - give them a break that encourages them to leave the social welfare programs and go to work.
We could have an urban homestead act.
We've got thousands and thousands of homes owned by government boarded up, being vandalized, that have been taken in mortgage foreclosures.
What if we had a homestead act, and said to the people, for $1 we sell you this house.
All have to do is agree to refurbish it, make it habitable, and live in it - just as 100 or more years ago, we did with the open land in this country - urban .
or country homesteading.
Mr. May?
Mr. Anderson, let me ask you, what specific plans do you have for Federal involvement in saving cities from the physical and emotional crises that confront them, and how would you carry out those plans, in addition to raising military pay, without going against your pledge of fiscal restraint?
Mr. May, I recently saw a Princeton University study that indicated that the cities of America - the large cities of this country - are in worse shape today than they were in 1960.
It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America.
Incidentally, just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits.
I'm happy to say that, in contrast to that, the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America.
We call, first of all, for the creation of a $4 billion urban reinvestment trust fund to do exactly what you spoke about in your question - to rebuild the streets, to rebuild the cities, the leaking water mains.
I was in North Pittsburgh - I think it was a few weeks ago, on my campaign - the water mains in that city had begun to leak, and literally, there wasn't money available to fix them.
And until we can begin to recreate the basic infrastructure of the great cities of America, particularly in the upper Midwest and in the Northeast, they simply are not going to provide the kind of economic climate that will enable them to retain industry, enable them to retain the kind of solid industrial base that they need, so that they can provide jobs.
We have also provided in our program for a $4 billion Community Trust Fund, and we've told you where the money is coming from.
It's going to come from the dedication, by 1984, of the excise revenues that today are being collected by the Federal Government on alcohol and tobacco.
That money, I think, ought to be put into rebuilding the base of our cities.
In addition to that, jobs programs to re-employ the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list, both the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980 and a billion-dollar program that I would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects, in conservation projects, in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country.
Mr. Reagan, your response.
Yes.
Government claims.
John claims that he is making plain where the money will come from.
It will come from the pockets of the people.
It will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas.
And the problem is, with Governments - Federal, State and Local - taking $.44 out of every dollar earned, that the Federal Government has pre-empted too many of the tax sources, and that the cities.
if Pittsburgh does not have the money to fix the leaking water mains, it's because the Federal Government has pre-empted.
Now, the Federal Government is going to turn around and say, well you have this problem; we will now hand you the money to do it.
But the Federal Government doesn't make money.
It just takes - from the people.
And in my view, this is not the answer to the problem.
Stand in the South Bronx as I did, in the spot where Jimmy Carter made his promise that he was going to, with multi-billion dollar programs, refurbish that area that looks like bombed-out London in World War II.
I stood there, and I met the people.
And I heard them ask just for something that would give them hope.
And I believe that, while all of the promises have been broken, they've never been carried out.
But I believe that my plan might offer an opportunity for that, if we would move into those areas and let, encourage - with the tax incentive - the private sector, to develop and to create the jobs for the people.
Mr. Anderson.
Well, of course, where has the private sector been, Governor Reagan, during the years that our cities have been deteriorating?
It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing: To 55% of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country.
We simply cannot ignore the fact that, in those cities today, we have 55% youth unemployment among black and Hispanic youth.
And why is that?
It's because they have lost their industry.
And why have they lost their industry?
It's because they no longer present the kind of viable economic climate that makes it possible for industry to remain there, or to locate there.
I think Government has a responsibility to find jobs for the youth of this country, and that the place to start is to assist in the very important and necessary task of helping cities rebuild.
Jane Bryant Quinn has the next question, for you, Mr. Anderson.
Mr. Anderson, many voters are very worried that tax cuts, nice as they are, will actually add to inflation.
And many eminent conservatives have testified that even business tax cuts, as you have proposed, can be inflationary as long as we have a budget deficit.
Now, Mr. Reagan has mentioned that he put out a five-year economic forecast, which indeed he did, but it contained no inflation number.
You have published a detailed program, but it too does not have any hard numbers on it about how these things work with inflation.
So I would like to ask you, if you will commit to publish specific forecasts within two weeks, so that the voters can absorb them and understand them and analyze them, showing exactly what al these problems you've mentioned tonight - on energy, on defense, on the cities - how these impact on inflation, and what inflation's actually going to be over five years.
Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think it's going to cost, because I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver.
When these Presidential Debates were held just four years ago, I remember the incumbent President, who was willing to debate, President Ford, telling the American people that they simply ought not to vote for somebody who promised more than they could deliver.
Well, we've seen what has happened.
We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we haven't gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter's first term.
Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%.
And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index - that's about 18% on an annualized basis - what it's going to be.
Let me say this.
I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan.
His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information.
He went so far as to call it "brutal economics."
I've been very careful - I have been very careful in saying that what I'm going to do is to bring Federal spending under control first.
I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done.
But, you know, it's gotten to be about $122 difference.
Somebody worked it out.
And they figured out that between the tax cut that Governor Reagan is promising the American people, and the tax cut that Jimmy Carter is promising in 198I, his is worth about $122 more.
So you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes.
And one is going to give you $122 more if you happen to be in that range of about a $20,000-a-year income.
I'm going to wait until I see that that inflation rate is going down, before I even begin to phase in the business tax cuts that I've
