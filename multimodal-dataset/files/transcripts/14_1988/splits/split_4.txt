and fighting drugs.
He's taken it down some four percent in the high schools of that state, while it's gone up about the rest of the nation.
But you would seem him as president of the United States being very aggressive in this fight against crime, and having that kind of a successful result.
And that's one of the reasons I'm delighted and proud to be on the ticket with him.
Sure, we have some differences, but overall we have so many things we agree on.
This situation of a trade policy, of cutting back on the deficit.
Those are positive, plus things, and major issues facing our nation.
Senator Quayle.
One of the things that they don't agree on is in the area of national defense.
National defense, and how we're going to preserve the freedom in this country.
Michael Dukakis is the most liberal national Democrat to seek the office of presidency since George McGovern.
He is for - he is against the MX missile, the midgetman, cutting two aircraft carriers.
He is opposed to many defense programs that are necessary to defend this country.
That's why former Secretary of Defense and former Energy Secretary in the Carter administration, Jim Schlesinger, in an open letter to Time magazine asked Governor Dukakis, "are you viscerally anti-military?"
Jim Schlesinger never got an answer.
And the reason he did is because the governor of Massachusetts doesn't want to answer former Secretary Jim Schlesinger on that very important question.
Tom, a last question for Senator Quayle.
Senator Quayle, all of us in our lifetime encounter an experience that helps shapes our adult philosophy in some form or another.
Could you describe for this audience tonight what experience you may have had, and how it shaped our political philosophy?
There are a lot of experiences that I've had that have shaped my adult philosophy, but the one that I keep coming back to time and time again - and I talk about it at commencement addresses, I talk about it in the high schools.
I talk about it when I visit the job training centers.
And it's the advice that my maternal grandmother, Martha Pulliam, who's 97 years old.
We are a modern day, four generation family.
The advice that she gave me when I was growing up is advice that I've given my children, and I've given to a number of children, number of people.
And it's very simple.
It's very common sense.
And she says, "You can do anything you want to if you just set your mind to it, and go to work."
Now, the Dukakis supporters sneer at that because it's common sense.
(Laughter)
They sneer at common sense advice.
Midwestern advice.
Midwestern advice from a grandmother to a grandson.
Important advice.
Something that we ought to talk about, because if you want to, you can make a difference.
You, America can make a difference.
You're going to have that choice come this election.
Everyone can make a difference if they want to.
Senator Bentsen?
I think being born and reared on the Rio Grande, to have spent part of my life seeing some of the struggles that have taken place in one of the lowest per capita incomes in the United States.
And that's one of the reasons I worked so hard to try to assist on education.
And when I found that the bankers in that area found that they could not handle the loans because of some of the detail and the expense, couldn't make a profit on it, I went down there and helped form a nonprofit organization, to buy out those loans from them, and to manage them, and do it in a way where they'd continue to make those loans.
Now they have.
And they've educated more than 20,000 of those students, loaned out over a hundred million dollars.
And it hasn't cost the taxpayers of this country one cent.
That's one of the reasons I've worked so hard to bring better health care to the people, because what I've seen in the way of poverty down there in that area, and the lack of medical attention, and trying to see that that's turned around; why I've worked so hard on the welfare reform bill--to give them a chance to break these cycles of poverty, a chance for a step up in life.
Judy, something's happened.
My light's still on.
Your light's not working.
All right.
We're sorry about that if that's the case.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Bentsen.
Thank you, Senator Quayle.
We have now come to the end of the questions, and before I ask the candidates to make their closing remarks, on behalf of the Commission on Presidential Debates, I'd like to thank all of you for joining us.
Senator Quayle, yours is the first closing statement.
Thank you.
Tonight has been a very important evening.
You have been able to see Dan Quayle as I really am, and how George Bush and I want to lead this country into the future.
Thank you, America, for listening, and thank you for your fairness.
Now you will have a choice to make on election day.
You will have a choice of whether America is going to choose the road of Michael Dukakis or the road of George Bush as we march toward the 21st Century.
The road of Michael Dukakis comes down to this: Bigger government, higher taxes.
They've always believed in higher taxes; they always have, and they always will.
Cuts in national defense.
Back to the old economics of high interest rates, high inflation, and the old politics of high unemployment.
Now the road of George Bush is the road to the future, and it comes down to this: An America second to none, with visions of greatness, economic expansion, tough laws, tough judges, strong values, respect for the flag and our institutions.
George Bush will lead us to the 21st Century, a century that will be of hope and peace.
Ronald Reagan and George Bush saved America from decline.
We changed America.
Michael Dukakis fought us every step of the way.
It's not that they're not sympathetic; it's simply that they will take America backwards.
George Bush has the experience, and with me, the future, a future committed to our family, a future committed to the freedom.
Thank you, good night, and God bless you.
(Applause)
Senator Bentsen, your closing statement.
In just 34 days, America will elect new leadership for our country.
It's a most important decision, because there's no bigger job than governing this great country of ours, and leading it into its future.
Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen offer you experience, tempered, capable leadership, to meet those challenges of the future.
Our opposition says lower your sights, rest on your laurels.
Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen think America can do better, that America can't just coast into the future, clinging to the past.
This race is too close.
The competition is too tough, the stakes are too high.
Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen think America must move into that future united in a commitment to make this country of ours the most powerful, the most prosperous nation in the world.
As Americans, we honor our past, and we should.
But our children are going to live in the future, and Mike Dukakis says the best of America is yet to come.
But that won't happen.
Taking care of our economy, just putting it on automatic pilot.
It won't happen by accident.
It's going to take leadership, and it's going to take courage.
And the commitment, and a contribution by all of us to do that.
I've worked for the betterment of our country, both in war and peace, as a bomber pilot, as one who has been a businessman, and a United States senator, working to make this nation the fairest and the strongest and the most powerful in the world.
Help us bring America to a new era of greatness.
The debate has been ours, but the decision is yours.
God bless you.
